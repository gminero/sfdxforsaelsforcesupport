            "long_summary__c": "My family bought me a Bonavita 1900 TS for Father's day. Unfortunately after burning through 3/4 of a bag of coffee, I still haven't produced a good tasting carafe of coffee. Every time, it comes out (varying levels, but still) bitter and dry. nI tried grinding (with my Capresso Infinity) in the exact middle setting and worked my way all the way to the most coarse setting under coarse. Can still go further, but I have a feeling I'm missing something. nI'm using BJ's Kona blend Arabica, medium roast. Yeah, not the highest grade stuff. But I like it good enough from my old 12 cup Cuisinart at 6 scoops with 12 cups of water (per the coffeemaker measurement). nI've tried anywhere from 55-65g of grounds with 1L of water in the Bonavita. Which is way more grounds than I used to use in my old Cuisinart, but I'm trying to follow recommendations I've found online.  nAny ideas?nnnI recently purchased the Bonavita as well. After years of using basic automatic drip coffee makers this was an adjustment. I still haven't perfected the art of the cup using the Bonavita. The problem is that the Bonavita brews at the correct temperature, so I think you really need to be a little more precise when brewing (at least that's what I discovered).nFirst of all, the Bonavita brews only 8 cups--and each cup is only 5 oz. I use a scale to get as close as I can to the correct water-coffee ratio. I no longer use a scoop: a scale is the way to go.nI have found that with the Bonavita a medium course grind is best. I also found that lighter roasts are less likely to produce the bitter flavor you are experiencing.nI usually brew at a water ratio of 1:14. So that means that I use about 84 grams of coffee for a full pot. I know, seems like a lot of coffee. i never used that much with my Mr. Coffee.  But, once you figure out the correct grind and amount, the Bonavita produces a great cup of coffee.nGo to https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/ and read the article. The 'Coffee Compass' really helped me out in trying to get that great cup. Just the other day, I ground up some coffee at a slightly higher setting and the coffee was weak. So now, using that setting, I had to up the amount of coffee by a couple of grams and it was perfect. And that was thanks to the Coffee Compass.nIt is so trial and error, I have to say.nHere are the basic ratios to use with the Bonavita. I have found that the 1:14 produces the better cup in my opinion. Also, lighter roasts tend to not be as bitter as the darker roasts.nnBonavita cup = 5 oz. (147.87 grams = 1 Bonavita cup or 29.574 grams ann  ounce) Each cup = 5.215 ouncesn4 Bonavita Cups = 20 oz = 591.47 g   (Ratios:  1:14=42 g; 1:15=39 g;n  1:16=37 g) Note: Finer grind n5 Bonavita Cups = 25 oz = 739.33 g (Ratios:  1:14=53 g; 1:15=49 g; 1:16=46 g) n6 Bonavita Cups = 30 oz = 887.20 g   (Ratios:  1:14=63 g; 1:15=59 g; 1:16=55.45 g) Note: Medium grind n8 Bonavita Cups = 40 oz =1182.94 g  (Ratios:  1:14=84.5 g; 1:15=79 g; 1:16=74 g) Note: Courser grindnnHope this helps. Happy brewing.nnnI asked a similar question and got back use a coarser grind to slow the extraction. I have a Capresso too and I am set in the middle of the Course section up to the right. nI got a Bonavita 5-cup a week ago and I'm still playing around with it. I'm a big fan of metal reusable filters because I swear coffee made with paper filters had an odd taste.nnnI have the Bonavita BV1900TS brewer with a Baratza Preciso grinder.  I actually have two sets, one for work and one for home.  I have pre-infusion enabled, if that matters in this case.nI also have a VST refractometer that can measure the brewed coffee to determine its strength and also derive if it is too bitter or not.  I have been able to get good results out of the Bonavita.nI can only say that once I started measuring the coffee I have moved to coarser grind that what was originally recommended.   You have said you have tried coarse so I'm not sure what the issue might be.  I would maybe try to readjust your grinder by adjusting while it is running and empty.  Turn it all the way to fine and then open it back up to as coarse as you can make it, while the grinder is running.nI have been using 40g of coffee with 700ml of water in, so maybe give that a try with the coarse grounds just to see if you can make it not taste bitter.  You might also try one other type of fresh beans as another data point.nMy friend had the Capresso Infinity and it left a lot of grinds in it, so you might want to tilt it and tap out some of the old grinds before you adjust it.nnnI purchased one of the Bonavita 1900 TS brewers for my Dad for his birthday, while I still use a 12 cup Cuisinart with thermal carafe at home.  We have identical grinders for home use.  What I have found is that he uses significantly less grounds to make a pot of coffee.  While I will use 8-8.5 scoops in an 8 cup pot on the cuisinart (about 7.5g per scoop) ground at very slightly finer than medium, on the Bonavita, he uses 5 scoops ground at the same level.  Personally this produces coffee a bit too thin for me, but the entire family things it is great.  When I am visiting I bump it up to closer to 6-7 scoops and it comes out good.nCouple things.  Bitter coffee is due to over extraction.  This could be grind level, amount of coffee being used or water temperature.  Let's presume for now that water temp is ok since it is a nearly new, high quality machine.  nSince you have already been working with the grind level, I would suggest you back off the amount of coffee you are using and see if that produces any positive results.  This machine definitely brews 'stronger' given the same input parameters.nSome posts have indicated that your grinder cannot grind coarse enough for a true coarse grind.  I'm unfortunately not familiar with your particular grinder so this also may be the case.  Regardless, if you are getting bitter coffee and you have ground as coarse as you can, then backing off the amount of grounds should net some improvement.  If you get to the point that your coffee is both thin, and bitter, then I would probably start thinking about replacing the grinder, although I hate to recommend purchasing new equipment when it appears you should already be set up for success.  nnnI have a new Bonavita 1900 and I had a devil of a time dialing it in.  However, I'm now getting good coffee so I'll explain what I've done.  My problem, like yours, was bitterness so my first step was to increase the weight of the coffee grounds to 85gms (for 8 cups) to reduce the extraction.  This helped a little but it was still bitter, so at that point I knew I had to increase the grind size. Unfortunately my Capresso Infinity grinder wouldn't go any coarser so I bought a Baratza Encore grinder, worked up to a 30 grind setting (quite coarse), and the bitterness was gone. Then I reduced the coffee weight to 80gms per Bonavita's recommendation and things are good.   nnnIt could be your grinder, grind settings make a huge difference in flavor. You would be surprised what a notch or two on your grinder will do.nOr it could also be your beans. You mentioned they are a medium roast.The darker in roast you go the more it adds 'roast' flavors to the beans. nMaybe try going for a lighter roast?nn",

            "long_summary__c": "Often when brewing coffee I end up with an oily film that rises to the top of the cup. How do I reduce or brew coffee without it?nMy current set up is using a french press and Lavazza Rossa coffee (I know a fine grind isn't recommended for french press, however being an amateur with a french press I simply bought the brand with a french press on label).nnnnRegarding the pre-ground coffee in a French Press, the website, packaging and company all say its suitable for a French Press / Plunger.  Technically it is, the big thing is usually the finer grounds being sifted through the filter and into your cup of coffee.  Most people don't like this, I personally don't mind this, though I do prefer not to have grounds in my coffee.  If you were to grind your own coffee, you may still get some finer particles pushing through, but not as much  nI too use a French Press and I noticed some odd things similar to the oily film when I first started.  I changed a TON of what I was doing, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what caused that to stop.  Here is a few things.  nnThe grounds of the coffee could be part of that film.  As they sift through, some of the finest particles could be coalescing together and forming what looks like an oily film.nTry different grounds (just for a day, change it up)nThe appearance of that film could also be due to the sheen of the bean from processing.  Many flavored coffees, even a subtle flavor or a 'non-flavor' from a large company, are from the beans being in a flavor oil.  This being Lavazza, I see that it tastes like Pralines, which could be some of the flavor of the oil the company uses to mask any bitterness or roasting flavors.  Not all companies do this.nPossibly email company and see if they do add any oil to the coffee (even if its natural or during the roasting process)nCheck the cleanliness of the french press and coffee cup.  I wasn't washing mine thoroughly enough at the beginning and some of that was a residue from soap I am sure.nTry to fill the french press or coffee cup with water after washing, let sit and see if it produced filmnDish Washer and detergent.  I had an apartment that had a dish washer and when it started to 'go', it would still 'clean' things but we would notice that everything had a film on it that was pretty much invisible.  We could tell because we would pour a glass of water, then see the film a couple minutes later.  Sometimes it was obvious.  It could also be the detergent in the dish washer.nTry to hand-wash your coffee cup and french press and see if that makes a difference.nCheck the water.  You may not have control over the water or the quality of the water, but that can play a factor in that oily film.  If the water is not purified or already has a residue, then your coffee will be the same.nPour a glass of water from the same source and let it sit for 15 minutes and see if you get a film.nBag, packaging and storage.  I have a coffee vault for one of coffee's, and when I ran out and reordered more I put a different bean in there.  The previous bean was flavored and some of the oil from the flavor rubbed off on the sides, which then transferred to the new unflavored beans and caused some oily film.  So again, make sure its washed well.  But also, I noticed some bags or packaging have a metallic looking liner inside the bag, and that I feel is often oily.  I am not sure from what or why, could be a preservative coating or just some oil so there isn't bean on metal contact.  That may also transfer to the bean as well.nCheck the inside of the bag and see if that has any oil residue inside.  Also email company see if they coat the inside of their packaging.nLastly, I forgot, but this goes with washing your french press, wash it as soon as you are done.  Out of forgetfulness or laziness I have left my old brew in there overnight a few times, and I have noticed that the next one may have some residue from the previous still, which may be some of that oily film.nTry washing right away after done with coffeennGood luck, hope this helps and try to keep changing things and see what works for you.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I enjoy the smooth taste produced by my Mizodashi cold brew jug, but prefer hot coffee.  Although I can dilute the cold brew with hot water, it gives me a pretty weak coffee (although great tasting).nSo, the basic question is how can I create a concentrate with the smooth taste of cold brew that I can take into work and make my own coffee?nnnLike @Shiri said in comments above (and hopes that I'm not answer-sniping), most recipes for cold-brew are concentrates. Within reason, try brewing with a smaller amount of water! Compare guides like Kicking Horse, Stumptown, Blue Bottle.nIn my experience (except for the problems that I've had with filtering) brewing a lower volume of water generates very similar results when diluted. Said the other way, brewing with a higher ratio of coffee :: water, then diluting, is my preferred way of brewing, storing, and consuming.nThat said, do store in a neutral vessel that is easy to clean (my preference is a wide-mouth glass jar). Stored in the fridge, it will last several days (maybe a week) and still taste okay. In a plastic jug (or so) it might 1- start to obtain bad tastes from the container, and 2- infect the jug with stale coffee taste over time. Coffee oils (etc.) can be hard to remove especially when cold.nSome additional information is in related questions are about ratios and concentration and a concentration table in this answer.nnnThis is my first answer, and I'm sharing my own personal method for making concentrate. Hope this helps!nFirst: Source your coffee!nMy preference is very fresh, bright, fruity blends direct from a roaster or coffee house; a reputable barista will have a suggestion of which one makes a good cold brew. I strongly advise against cold brewing grocery store coffee as the resulting flavor will not be worth the effort, even when buying the more expensive, grind-it-yourself coffee. It's not fresh enough!nThe grind should be slightly coarser than what would be used for a regular drip coffee maker and generally your barista will gladly grind for you.nMost important:nUse a 1:1 ratio, ounces coffee :: cups waternExamples:nn1 ounce coffee : 1 cup watern4 ounces coffee : 4 cups / 1 quart watern12 ounces coffee : 12 cups / 3 quarts of water*n16 ounces coffee : 16 cups / 4 quarts / 1 gallon waternn*This is my most common ratio; I consistently get 11 cups of concentrate from 12 cups of water. This results in about 11 pints of coffee when mixed as directed.nUseful tools:n1) Large container in which to brew. Make sure you can cover the container to keep out contaminants. A pitcher or carafe with lid is ideal, and a wide-mouth will help with cleanup and removal of the used grounds. My preference is glass but plastic may be adequate. Previously I had recommended the Bormioli Rocco Airtight Jar in 5 liter capacity but have found that it isnu2019t ideal when brewing with a bag.n2) A sieve, bag, or both to strain the mixture after brewing and before filtering. A nut-milk bag is especially useful - I've been using one to brew and it has made the filtering process quite a lot quicker, cleaner, and easier than filtering with a sieve alone.n3) A fine filter to remove the smaller silt from the mixture. A regular paper coffee filter is the perfect tool for this step, naturally, and you can use the sieve mentioned above to support it.nSteps:nMeasure out coffee and water separately.nIf you're using a bag to brew, place the bag in to the container, then fill the bag with the coffee.nIf you're not using a bag, simply put the coffee in to the container.nSlowly pour the water over the coffee to soak the grounds completely.nClose up your container for about 10 minutes in order to allow for the coffee grounds to become saturated through.nIf you're not using a bag, you'll notice all the grounds at the top of the mixture at the end of the waiting period; if you are using a bag you probably won't notice any difference. In either case, use a non-metal (wooden or plastic) spoon or spatula to submerge the grounds in to the mixture. If you're using the bag, treat it like a teabag and simply dunk it repeatedly. If you're not using a bag, you can mix vigorously.nAllow to brew for 24 hours at room temperature. Periodically you may wish to agitate the mixture as the grounds may sink to the bottom if you're not using a bag, and we want to maximize the coffee grounds contact with the water in order to maximize the flavor extraction.nAfter 24 hours, strain & filter out coffee grains.nBag method:n - Remove bagn - Empty grounds in to bin and rinse bagn - Pour mixture through paper filter in to storage containernSieve method:n - Pour mixture slowly through sieve in to intermediate containern - Empty sieve as necessary through processn - Pour mixture through paper filter in to storage containernThe strained mixture will be a concentrated brew of the most delicious nectar of nature. Mix resulting concentrate with water at 1:1 ratio to serve; my preference is chilled with ice but it's also quite delicious if boiling water is added to the room temperature concentrate.nnnThere are at least four 'flavor dials' that you can tune to get a stronger flavor out of cold brewing. nnThe roast. A darker roast may produce a stronger flavor, but maybe you don't like darker roasts. Keep in mind that the cold brewing process will produce a smoother result, so you might be pleasantly surprised by the results.nThe temperature. You can try putting warmer water into your coffee initially, or warming it up right at the end. This may extract more flavor. Obviously it goes against the principle of cold brewing, and it might extract some flavors you don't like. But it's worth trying to see what you think.nThe grind. A finer grind may extract more flavor, but you'll have to pass the concentrate through filter paper in that case. nThe ratio of coffee to water. Use less water to more coffee for a stronger flavor.nnIf you try all of those things and it's still too weak, then I really don't know what to say! nn",

Also, what type of beans would you take on such a trip and how would you store them?nnnI'm going to focus on the 'old-school' aspect of your question.nFrom my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing 'camp coffee' is a percolator. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a 'stovetop espresso maker', though I don't care for that term) -- there are some very compact moka pots like this one that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on the difference between a percolator and a moka pot. Those are my preferences for camp coffee.nFor a little more technology, you can use integrated heater/container systems like the JetBoil; they also have small accessories like this French press insert so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, and (separately) use it to make coffee).nOn the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use instant coffee or try coffee bags such as these, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see instructables and MtBoE). Though there are tradeoffs and reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).nStorage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about storage in general and vacuum-sealing. You could always use a hand grinder, but that's more gear and more weight.nIn sum: I go 'fast and light' for coffee on the trail: gear that's reasonably light, that I can use quickly (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!nnnI think an AeroPress would work great on a trip.  Just need hot water.nAeroPress Video Tutorial How To :: Inverted AeroPress Video Tutorial (YouTube)nSee also other questions tagged aeropress.nnnI answered a previous question about making coffee with eggs that might also address your question.  The method is very simple and I see no reason why you couldn't do the same thing without the eggs.  Here is my original answer below:nnI don't know any history behind the practice but I learned it myself during a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon back in the early '90's. The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel. Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.nnYour method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.  A small French press might also suit your needs just fine.  You should test out your method before you go, though.nnnI agree that the Aeropress is a good option for making your coffee - I actually take one of those with me when I go on road trips so that I don't have to rely on terrible gas station coffee! I also found this article on travel coffee makers that might help you out. As for storing your beans, it needs to be something that is air tight and dark so that the light doesn't hit the beans.nnnI recommend the bialetti. I think thats how its spelled.  Its a stove top device (I suppose you could put it in a fire, too).  It makes some of the BEST homemade coffee Ive ever had. Highly recommended.  Its essentially an espresso machine, I put regular non-espresso coffee in it though. Still awesome.  It's non-electrical, the one I have is no more than a half-pound heavy and about 6 inches tall and 3 or 4 inch diameter base.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "When you're starting your shift at your coffee shop and take over the bar from another barista, the machine and grinder can be in varying states of cleanliness and calibration. How do you quickly and correctly get back to pulling good shots from clean equipment?nnnThis answer addresses a 'standard' semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.nCleaningnOf course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and 'wetness' from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with 'bumping' so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).n*especially under the basket.nCalibratingnThe abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak. nnhttp://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.htmlnTo fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls. nnFrob. In the frob pass, we make just 'coarse' adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't aimless.) nTwiddle. In the twiddle pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more 'scientific' manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as 'controls' for the quick little 'experiments' to check each change.  nTweak. In the tweak pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.nnThe controls we have available are the grind, dose, and water quantity. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be constant. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.nIn the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting 'clicks' of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to 'full', maybe a little heaping. This number is your base dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the 'frob' of the dose.nSet the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the 'frob' of the water quantity.nIf the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the 'frob' of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.nSo, we've done our 'frob' pass. Now 'twiddle.' Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a 'twiddle' of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to 'twiddle' per se: there's no *up and down' here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.nThen do a 'twiddle' of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its 'range', if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.nThere should be no need to 'twiddle' the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. nNow, one final pass to 'tweak'. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white 'overextraction stain' where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop just before the color changes. This tweak gives you 'ristretto-quality' shots.nAdjusting on-the-flynRemember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is 'comfortable'. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to 'ride the wave' of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.nThe same three adjustments, frob, twiddle, and tweak, apply also to dynamic adjustments. Frob, the coarsest control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. Twiddle, the medium-grain control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. Tweak, the finest control is the dose.nIf a shot pulls 1-second too long, tweak your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.nIf a shot pulls 1-second too short, tweak your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.nIf the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), twiddle the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same density with more mass.nIf the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), twiddle the grind a little finer so you can achieve the density with less mass. (Volume is constant.)nnI actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.nOn a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.nThat's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.n--nAppendix: The 'David Schomer' method or 'ritual'nThis is what I remember from the amazing book, Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques by David Schomer. And hey Matt, I want my copy back!nA. Preheat and Clean.nnPull an ounce or so of water through the old spent puck to heat the group.nYank the portafilter and knock the old puck into the compost bin.nWipe the basket and run a splash of water through the group without the portafilter to rinse the upper screen. (You can catch this water with the portafilter before wiping to rinse more of the grounds so your clean towel stays clean longer.)nnB. Grind and Dose.nnTurn on grinder to start to fill the doser (which should be as empty as practical).nImmediately start pulling clicks of the doser until the basket is full, or a little heaping.nTurn off grinder.nnC. Distribute and Tamp.nnWith clean hands, distribute the grounds evenly with a finger (I use my ring finger, but whatever works).nTamp lightly to shape the puck.nTap the edge with the handle end of your nice aluminum tamper that you bought yourself and brought to work to help. This gets the little bit of coffee around the edge that the tamper missed.nTamp firmly, from the elbow. About 30 pounds of pressure.nReinsert the portafiler.nnD. Brew.nnClick the button to start brewing. nImmediately discard the hot water from the shot glasses which is still there from step A.1.nWatch the pour and stop it early if you need to, to catch the sweet spot.nnAnd finally, I apologize for my excessive use of emphatic 'quotation marks'.nnnThis answer addresses a Super-Automatic machine with built-in automatic grinder/doser/tamper. Specifically the Starbucks Mastrena machine, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.nTLDR;nPull the grind back XX clicks coarser (XX=5 small recalib., XX=10 big recalib., XX=20 emergency (piston/powder errors -- but call service on it, too)).nKeep pulling pairs until it settles down to running consistent shots (howsoever fast). Check for dry pucks in the drawer.nTake it back up. Repeat: (Pull 1 pair of shots, Turn 1 click finer). Stop turning finer at 16 or 17 and it will ride up to 18-23s. (Mnemonic: 'blackjack house rules'.)nRinsingnYou should always be rinsing. You are not done rinsing until the water runs clear.nThe water you see is the water you were about to brew with. Don't brew with brown water!nCleaningnIf the machine is acting up, give it a cleaning cycle. If a coworker challenges you, ask them why they want to serve bad shots??! Or better, calmly explain that it's the obvious thing to do to get back on track. Unpredictable shots == unpredictable drink production times. nIf you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. nSuper-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the 'oatmeal bowl problem'. If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.nExtending the analogy, suppose your friend drops by to borrow that book and you've had three bowl of oatmeal already and you offer your friend a bowl... You wash the bowl first ... right?nBreak it down.nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.  nI repeat:nStep 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.  nWhile it's pilling, you can soak the steam wand (all the way up past the holes at the top, tube removed.), and remove the hoppers and vacuum the grinders. nWipe out the oils from the grinders with a napkin or paper towel (no water up there!)nWhen it's done pilling, you can take the drawer and the tray and the spout to wash.nVacuum and/or wipe grounds from the carcass and reach up with a towel and clean the two ribs.nThen, clean the heart. Just between the ribs there are two circles, one on your side and one a few inches away on the other side. With a towel, wipe any crusty stuff from the edges of the two circles. These are the two halves which come together to form the brewing chamber, the crucible of the alchemy.nIf you really want to treat your machine (maybe it's the machine's birthday), give it another pill before bringing it back up. Blast out the steam till it's nice and dry. Scrape and remove all the milk residue until its just shiny shiny metal. Bottle-brush the steam tube.nDeep-cleaning the steam wandsnThen give its buddy some love.nCalibrating.nI'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the controls here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. nEach programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print 'adjust grind coarser' or 'adjust grind finer' on the screen. So, the machine only 'sees' a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) 'too much inconsistency'. Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel. (You can still queue shots but pressing Cancel to switch back to normal view will also remove the last queued shot just as it does on normal view.)nIf the numbers are 'too inconsistent' (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.nAlright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks coarser than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to caking in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual 'death-spiral' of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.nIf it's acting really bad, you may need to go more-than-a-few clicks coarser. Following my own advice today took a lot longer than the official '10 clicks coarser, pull 10 pairs, then adjust by pulling 3 pairs between each grind change' that we currently follow (when I'm not around) probably would have done.nSo, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. nIt takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.nHow to know if you've gone coarse enoughnThe signs I've been looking for (which I kept not getting today) is a run of short shots at around 10sec that all look the same and leave the shot glasses mostly clear at the second rinse. I also look to see if its producing dry pucks in the drawer. If the puck explodes into mush, that's what we used to call a shot that didn't 'catch' on the old machines.nRun of short shots + clean at the second rinse + dry pucks == take it back up.nCross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grindnIf you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.nThe procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.nAlways, always, always, calibrate from the coarse side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.nAdjusting on the flynI posted this idea some years ago in facebook.nnI've begun to notice a pattern in the shot times on the Mastrenas.n   The first pair from a run are short, because the brewing chamber isn   relatively cold. As the chamber heats, grinds begin to accumulaten   on the interior, increasing the effective dose (therefore proportion,n   therefore density), progressively pulling longer and muddier shots.nSo, aside from rinsing like fanatics as you all already ought to do.n   You can:n   Before the first shot, click it finer.n   About 2 pairs into the run, click it back coarser.n   4 or 5 pairs after that, click it one more coarser. This is yourn   'cruise' setting.nLarger flakes should act more like 'fiber' and keep the chamber scrubbed. But you need to go finer at the start to compensate for lower temperature.nIf it's been a long time (>15 minutes), then your first pair are not onlyn   cold but stale. If it's your mom, don't serve her those shots.nUnlike the Verismos (and the Astorias, too, for that matter), these n   Mastrenas seem to have a very small doser so the effect of grind-change n   is quite rapid. This first pair will be a blend of the old setting and the new. n   The second pair is most or all fresh ground.nnUnresolved issuesnThe triple shot button. Right now on one machine we have the single part grinding longer than the double part, and I don't know how to get them untwisted.nPiston/Position/Powder ErrorsnCall Service! But also, try this until they get there:nnCross your fingers.nPull a decaf single.nRinse.nThrow a pinch of cinnamon over your shoulder.nRinse again.nPull a half-caff double.nRinse again.nSee 'Emergency recalib, above.nn[n.b This is not official Starbucks policy, but my own private theory developed over the past 10 years of working with this machine (and its predecessor the Verismo). Other Starbucks Baristas should follow this advice only if comfortable with having to explain what you're doing to the other Baristas (and Managers) who may be staring at you wondering what you think you're doing. nSo, look out for yourselves.]nn",

The new sales girl must have misunderstood something and used a too-fine setting, finest (for espresso) instead of second finest (for my moka).nNow if I use it, I get many grounds in the top container and basically have to discard about a quarter of the brew each time as its just a grainy sludge at the bottom. Not the end of the world, but rather unpleasant.nIs there a kind of 'hack' how I could still use the perfectly fine coffee?  nnnIn this case, my usual pre-coffee tiredness solved the problem:nI had planned to mix the espresso grind with my usual grind to minimize the total amount of grounds in the cup. The idea was n1/2 too-fine grounds -> 1/2 the amount of dregs in the coffee.nnBeing tired, I only remembered this when I had already filled the moka more than half-way with the too-fine grind, so I just topped it up with the other kind and coooked my coffee.  nBut lo and behold: There were no coarse grounds in my pot - just some super-fine ones that weren't noticeable. I have since repeated the experiment a few times and can confirm that a top layer of 'just right' grounds seems to be able to hold back most of the too-fine crumbs, especially those responsible for the 'gritty' mouthfeel.nnA top layer of 1/4th to 1/3rd of the correct grind proved sufficient as 'filter' in my experiments. nAlso, there is no excess clogging of the moka, causing the valve to trigger or hot steam/water escaping round the gasket. The pot works just as usual. Of course one may not compact the coffee grounds in the brewing chamber, but that's standard procedure.nnnI don't think there's really a solution to your problem, except minimizing the sludge by pouring it in your cup really carefully.nI can think of one thing which would be quite hacky and might build up too much pressure in your stove top coffee maker. It is something I would try but would not recommend to anyone else. I have seen moka pots that weren't closed properly and almost exploded or that lacked the mesh filter inside and just kind of clocked up and then erupted a big fountain of hot coffee like a volcano. It's not pretty and rather dangerous. However I would put an aeropress like round paper filter (or any other thin paper/cloth filter cut into the right shape) inside on your coffee grounds or under the mesh filter. That would keep out the fines, but might lead to said increase of pressure (a Bialetti stove top has a pressure valve for security reasons, I've never seen it do it's job though). There's no guaranty that this would work or that no one gets hurt though, so I'm not suggesting you do it.nnnTry using a more controlled heat source.nI find that brewing with a Moka pot on aggressive heat source that deliver high heat very quickly tend to produce high pressures in the chamber which, in your case, can be causing it to carry the coffee grounds upwards also.nIf you brew on a lower heat and bring up the heat gradually, the pressure will build up slower and may reduce the amount of grounds shooting up into the collection chamber.nGood luck!nnnUse a simple mortar to make it finer before each cup (to keep it as fresh as possible and also to minimize the pain) and go for Turkish.nnnYou could try to do a version of cold brewing it or a toddy method.

According to this review of the literature on the subject:nnThere is no evidence that caffeine has any harmful effect on bonen  status or on the calcium economy in individuals who ingest then  currently recommended daily allowances of calcium.nnThat said, there does seem to be a connection between high caffeiene intake and low calcium intake, meaning that there is significant overlap between individuals who drink caffeinated beverages and don't get enough calcium from their diets, but implying a causal relationship is dubious. Luckily,nn...the negative effect of caffeine on calcium absorption is small enoughn  to be fully offset by as little as 1-2 tablespoons of milk.nnMost milk alternatives (like soy or almond milks) are fortified with calcium and other nutrients and drinking them in place of milk should do the trick, just be mindful of the high sugar content of many of the milk alternatives available.nAlso, I wouldn't worry about your daily coffee dose, 1.4 billion cups of coffee [2] are poured every day and if there were serious health risks associated with daily caffeine ingestion, we'd know about them!nn",

Doctors have prescribed me regular anxiety reliever drugs and also asked me to completely stay away from tea, coffee, cola or any other beverages having caffeine.nI don't heed to their advice. But I do feel tense if I have coffee especially in excessive dose. However I am addicted to coffee.nNow why coffee is bad for me and how much caffeine per day is safe for me?nnnNote:  I'm not a doctor, information below is based on the fact that I've done a lot of supplementation for working out, and have done a good amount of research into those supplements.  I would recommend following the advise of a doctor before anything I say, and fact check anything you read!nCaffeine is a vasoconstrictor.  In general, nervous tension / anxiety has a side effect/symptom/cause of high blood pressure.  Couple high blood pressure with a drug that makes your blood vessels more narrow, and you have even higher blood pressure.  While under normal circumstances, caffeine might slightly elevate blood pressure, if you are already in a situation where it is high, it may cause more serious issues.  In addition to this, caffeine does increase energy, makes you more jittery.. essentially increases tension!  So long story short, removing caffeine may reduce symptoms of your tension, and may also net you positive health benefits from removing it.nAs for how to get off caffeine.  Personally, I do this whenever I start working out in the gym and treat caffeine consumption as a cycling supplement.  This basically retains the affects of the drug without your system becoming too used to it.  It isn't very easy, but typically I stop drinking coffee completely, and when I start to get a headache, I have a 'cheat' meal and a cup of coffee.  Cheat meal meaning something reasonably high in fat.  What I've found is when I get a headache, many times a heavy dose of fat / carbs / protein can correct it very quickly.  What you will find when doing this is that you are providing an optimal condition to recover from the caffeine headache, but your body will quickly become used to not having caffeine so the headaches will go away in about a week.  That week is no fun at all, but you have to step back and think.. it's only 7 days.   nLastly, your ask about safe levels of caffeine.  This is basically impossible to determine based on the fact that 'safe levels' is entirely dependent on the individual.  Unfortunately, we probably need to refer you back to your doctor on this.  Ask questions of him!  Why no caffeine?  He may have a specific reason for it.  I won't go so far as to make a recommendation other than follow your doctors advice.nnnCaffeine effects everyone differently, both physiologically and psychologically. If your doctor(s) say to avoid caffeine, I would heed their advice. nGetting off caffeine can be uncomfortable but totally possible - start to reduce the amount you have every day (e.g. switch from regular coffee to regular tea to decaf coffee to nothing), and you will minimize headaches. It will take time to readjust to normal (2-4 weeks for me, but again, everyone is different), but it will happen, and you will notice you feel less anxious and more calm and steady.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "Iu2019m familiar with what the bloom is and why we do it. But all of the instructions and guides about pour-over coffee Iu2019ve ever seen recommend a specific time to let the coffee bloom before continuing with the brew. 40-45 seconds seems to be the most common consensus.nBut I have to assume that every coffee setup is going to be a little bit different. Small changes in the freshness of the beans, the size and shape of the grind, the temperature of the water, maybe even things like the mineral content of the water? - all of these factors and more are going to have at least some effect on how much CO2 the coffee wants to offgas and how long it takes. So, u201c45 secondsu201d seems like a good guideline or rule of thumb, but I would imagine that some brews need less time and some need more.nSo, if I want to gauge my bloom time by my senses instead of by the clock, what should I look for? I have noticed that toward the end of the bloom, the coffee starts to make a faint crackling noise. As the bloom u201cfallsu201d, it becomes flat, and then cracks begin to appear into the surface, and eventually it falls past flat and becomes a little bit concave. (When itu2019s flat and starting to crack it looks to me a little bit like a chocolate cookie. It makes me hungry in the morning.)nThatu2019s what Iu2019ve noticed so far about the u201cphasesu201d of the bloom. At which point in the process is it best to begin the rest of the pour?nnnThe bloom should be 30s for V60 and 40-45s for Chemex and Kalita and 30s for full immersion methods (like AeroPress or French Press). Blooming is not just about degassing but also to saturate the grounds (which obviously goes hand in hand) and to start dissolving solid compounds (mainly acids and caffeine, sugars come later).nIf you'd want to change, just to see what happens (I doubt you will make better coffee with blooming times that diverge a lot from those 'standards', since they have been proven to be optimal for the respective brewing devices used), then you could consider shortening the blooming time when the coffee is a few weeks old and has oxidized and degassed quite a bit. You notice when it stops bubbling, that would be a definite visual clue. If the same coffee that's been degassing until 30s (for V60), suddenly stops bubbling at 20s, you can try to reduce blooming time a bit. You'll run into trouble though, because your overall extraction time will likely be shorter until you figured out new grinder settings. The phases you describe really depend on the freshness of the coffee and the amount of CO2 it contains (darker roast would contain more e.g. because it's more porous). The slurry of very fresh coffee is still bubbly and has foam on top after 30s, not noticeably decreasing in volume, while a not so fresh coffee might fall flat after 15s already. I don't know what exactly you mean with cracks, I'll pay attention next time. More like holes where the CO2 exits, but I do agree it looks a little bit like chocolate cookies, when the coffee bed fell flat and the gas has mostly evaporated.nYou can stir with a wooden spatula/spoon/chop stick to make sure you saturate all the grounds, but in my opinion that is not necessary and I've noticed that too much agitation somehow screws up the brewing, often over extracting. Which makes sense, more agitation, faster extraction. If you pour it nicely in concentric circles agitating the grounds slightly, you can manage to saturate all grounds without stirring and without agitating too much. That's ideal in my opinion, but the opinions on this point split widely.nn",

It's common to see many brands proclaim that they are 100% Arabica blends as a quality hallmark. The characteristic and appealing aroma of brewing coffee comes from Arabica beans.nAnd Robusta which has more caffeine and is traditionally valued in Italy for it's ability to increase crema. It's also sometimes used to increase the caffeine in an espresso blend. Robusta is generally considered to have an inferior flavour profile to Arabica and usually commands lower prices and is largely relegated to use in lower quality, mass market instant coffee.nRobusta is a heirloom bean that was on the verge of extinction only thirty years ago and remains unknown to much of the world. It has a completely different flavour profile. Robusta are huge coffee berries tending towards somewhat intense smokey, nutty and dark chocolate notes in the cup.nArabica is rare in North America but is said to have a dedicated following in the Philippines, Indonesia & Malaysia where Liberica was planted by colonial Spaniards in the 1800's.nThink intense, complex, unusual and possibly overpowering to get an impression of how Liberica is likely to taste. Liberica has a caffeine content between that of Arabica and Robusta and likely a similar acidity profile.

You can use something to measure this volume like a graduated shot glass. Time how long this takes. I always aim for 20 seconds.

            "long_summary__c": "I often find that standard espresso shots at many high-end coffeeshops to be more sour than I prefer. I tend to order straight espresso, or Americanos with only a little water, or maybe a macchiatto, so there's not much fat to cut the tartness. What should I say to get a less acidic shot?nnnHere's a few thoughts based on what causes sourness/acidity in coffee and ways to temper it.nOrder an espresso lungo. Sourness (acidity) is characteristic of the 'stuff' that is extracted relatively early in the brewing process. In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso lungo. Not everyone behind every coffee counter will be immediately familiar with this, but at good cafes with good machines an espresso lungo should be no problem.nTry a darker roast. Darker roast coffees tend to be less acidic than lighter roasts, at the expense of losing more of the varietal/regional notes. Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean.nTry beans from a different region. To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees. Again, if multiple coffees are available for espresso, pick a coffee that you like (or find less sour) for any other preparation.nPick beans further off of the roast. This is really only for completeness, but beans that were very freshly/recently roasted (i.e., less than a few days) can have accentuated acidity because some undesirable volatiles haven't yet had a chance to leach out. This is more toward what @daniel noted; this is the kind of thing you shouldn't need to be concerned about at a cafe -- they should!nA cafe affiliated with a local roaster (or any specialty cafe) should be able to tell you lots of things about the coffee when asked, such as region, varietal, roast level, and roast date. Here's a Serious Eats article about 'problems' and related solutions that touch on some of the things I talked about above. Here's another link from Coffee Cuppers about regional and roast considerations in general.nnnTaste is subjective but a high-end espresso should not taste sour. Old coffee, poorly roasted coffee, and inferior grade coffee are the main culprits. nThe following is a pet theory, not science: cafes that charge a lot for coffee to cover overhead--or just because they think they can--sometimes have a low regard for the customer. Sometimes the best cup of espresso comes from a smaller cafe that depends on loyal customers for survival or is in business because the owner takes pride in serving good stuff. nYou shouldn't have to say anything to get a less acidic shot. If you are paying for good espresso you should get it--with the qualification that any cafe has a cycle of re-stocking and so some variation in quality is normal. nnnAs it was already mentioned some of the main parameters determining coffee taste are:nnCoffee related:nnbeans origin and quality.nbeans roasting and time passed.nbeans grounding and time passed.nnMachine related:nnwater quality.nwater desalination frequency.ngeneral cleanliness of the machine and the environment.nlower water temperature of extraction. If the machine temperature is lower due lack of periodical calibration, the coffee tastes sour and flat. nnPreparation related:nnextracted coffee exposure to the atmosphere. The longer is stays exposed, the more it reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and oxidizes, thus becoming more sour. This is true especially for all the coffees with added water (Americano, lungo) that breaks the thin layer covering and preserving the coffee's nice taste qualities.nnConsumption of additional beverage or/and snack together with the coffee. nnif the additional food or/and drink consumed together with the coffee contains more sugar, then your coffee will always taste sour. (The effect is similar to when you eat chocolate first and then eat an apple, the apple tastes much sour.) nsmoking affects taste receptors as well and it should be taken into consideration, i.e. you receptors are less sensitive and there is no point in buying coffee from high-end shops, as you are unable to feel the taste.nnnGenerally, if you want to experience the best quality of a given espresso, you should order it ristretto. The ordinary espresso extraction time is around 25 seconds (1ml / sec) and you get a full shot. Ristretto reduces the extraction time, usually by half, and cuts the last drops of water that contain lower concentration of coffee extract, thus keeping the strong aroma and different taste balance. In the ideal case it should be consumed as fast as possible, just like a gourmu00e9 meal.nn",

(A snapshot is available in Wayback Machine.)nParticularly relevant was their description of metabolism of caffeine:nnCaffeine is absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver cell and distributed to body tissues within 45 minutes of ingestion.nIt has a half-life of 3-5 hours in adults but can have a half-life of up to 80 hours in pregnant women prior to delivery.nnA technical term in the literature is 'oral clearance', meaning the rate at which a drug administered orally is removed from the body, the three elimination pathways being renal, hepatic, and pneumatic.  As the references in the above link document, caffeine is eliminated primarily by the liver breaking it down into paraxanthine (84%), theobromine (12%), and theophylline (4%).  While these last two compounds have some CNS effects, it is believed that largely caffeine itself acts by competing with adenosine for adenosine receptors.nnnThe simplest way to extend a caffeine buzz (setting aside pregnancy as impractical for most) is to consume more caffeine.  [A more difficult challenge might be finding a way to shorten the duration of a coffee buzz.]nA 1985 study by Abernethy and Todd, 'Impairment of caffeine clearance by chronic use of low-dose oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives', demonstrated that the half-life of caffeine is extended by progesterone administration.nYou say that you wish to consume as little coffee as possible, so perhaps the same amount of coffee (espresso, once every other day) could be taken in divided doses.  This then converts the problem into how to create an equally intense buzz with (say) only half the caffeine.nI've noticed is that a sharp reduction in carbohydrates leads (after a couple of weeks, with mild ketosis) to a stronger physiological response to caffeine.  nI can only offer this as an anecdotal observation.  There is research on the interaction of caffeine and glucose on cognitive processing and on the effects of caffeine consumption on glucose homeostasis.  But neither topic is precisely like what I'm suggesting.nnnWithout considering the amount or potency of the coffee as well as setting personal metabolism aside, you could adjust your coffee schedule according to your natural circadian rhythm, a methodology neuroscientist Steve Miller refers to as chronopharmacology.  Essentially, you use the caffeine as a propellant to your natural 'up' rhythm. Gabrielle Taylor's article does a fine job of explaining this:nnWhen you drink coffee during the time when your body is already releasing cortisol, it won't have as strong an effect. Ideally, you want to get your caffeine during the lulls between cortisol spikesu2014otherwise, you start to develop a tolerance and have to drink more to get the same effect.nAssuming you're on a regular sleep schedule, your cortisol levels naturally spike about an hour after you wake up. If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm.nSo, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm. Obviously you can adjust the schedule according to your own wake time if it's earlier or later. nnnnYou would like to prolong the 'high' that coffee i.e. caffeine causes. nCaffeine is metabolized by your liver. So anything that interferes with your liver metabolizing caffeine would extend the high, although habitual use would see this eroded by habituation. nThe 'half-life' of caffeine, which is how long it takes your body to eliminate half of the caffeine in your system is normally about five hours. A lot of foods, drugs and diseases can affect this though.nFor example, narigenin, the enzyme that makes grapefruit juice bitter inhibits CYP1A2 and can prolong the half-life of caffeine by 30% . Oral contraceptives can double the half life of caffeine. And various prescription drugs e.g. fluvoxamine significantly extend the half-life as well.nLiver disease can have dramatic effects. One lady with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis was reported in the literature as having a half-life of 168 hours for caffeine elimination. So her caffeine high would literally last for days after one espresso.nUnless you are taking a prescription drug that affects caffeine metabolism, your practical options would seem limited to grapefruit juice. Unless you were planning to undergo gender reassignment, then oral contraceptives would have a larger effect.nnnTaking caffeine in combination with L-Theanine may be linked better cognition, better mood, and a more stable high. It could possibly allow you to consume more caffeine without the classic caffeine jitters.nMany people in the nootropic community swear by it.nStudy by Simon P. Kelly, Manuel Gomez-Ramirez, Jennifer L. Montesi, and John J. Foxeabout about the possible synergy between caffeine and L-Theanine and cognitive performance.nStudy by Gail N. Owen, Holly Parnell, Eveline A. DeBruin, and Jane A. Rycroft about the combined effects on mood and cognition.nnnOut of personal experience, I get a pretty long and persistent buzz when I take coffee, go to sleep, and wake up 40-45 minutes later. nnnFunny you ask this. I can't remember the exact reason why, but I was just reading the other day that how hydrated you are has a pretty large effect on whether on your coffee tolerance. Turns out, the more water you drink, the more buzzed you feel. nIf I were you, I'd be careful. It's finals for me right now, and I have so much work, you wouldn't believe. Last night, I decided to drink a medium dark roast with a shot of expresso.... boy! I had the shakes. Every time I would try and concentrate, I could literally feel my brain itch.

Just make sure that you sip slowly.. and with discretion.nnnModified Esresso Romano is the answer; let's call it 'Espresso Hi-Grappo'.nAccording to @Modslacfilio's answer above, you may prolong the effects of caffeine by 30% if you consume it together with grapefruit juice. Grapefruit's pharmaceutical effect is well-known. Many drugs have a remark to not to be consumed together with grapefruits.nNow, we can modify espresso romano according to our needs. Normally, the espresso romano is a cup of espresso served with a slice of lemon. The lemon is served to counter the bitterness of espresso. In some places, I have encountered that a few drops of lemon juice is added directly inside the espresso. Why not grapefruit juice? Taste will be similar, additionally highness will be prolonged.nn",

Also I always preach to people that do put sugar in about how it ruins their coffee, due to the sour after-taste the sugar is adding.nIs there any chemical reaction here between the sugar and the coffee? Is it a result of a mixture between bitter and sweet that creates the sour taste?nWhen I tried having coffee without sugar I did feel like there is this sour feeling to it, but I also sometimes taste it with espresso made from some blends.nnnSugar adds a sweet taste to coffee, not a sour taste.  Sourness and sweetness are rather separate tastes! Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours.nSourness is a perception of acidity. In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., cola has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness). I don't see how sugar could be the cause of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). EDIT: That said, it might be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar reduces the perception of sourness, but it could be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) dissipates more quickly than the sourness (acids), you might be left with 'more sourness than sweetness' in the aftertaste after some time. That is, you're left with 'un-maksked' residual sourness which, though present all along, is more perceptible after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.nSweetness is perceived by the presence of sugar (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness perception). Sugar will also impact mouthfeel.nBitterness is separate also; see this question on salt and bitterness in coffee.nI don't think there are any chemical changes to the sugar happening in this case.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "The water heated in a metal boiler is kept mid-way, to create enough space for steam. The steam is used to heat milk and froth it. My question is, how does the level of water -- higher, lower, middle vertically inside the boiler -- affect the quality of steam?nnnBoiler water level has a significant effect on steam capacity and temperature stability. It may also impact steam quality.nThere are three steam characteristics to look at: the amount of steam available, steam power, which is pressure but it's easier to visualize this as velocity and quality. High quality steam should be dry and saturated, not wet. Within the safe (design) operating range of water level for your boiler, a lower water level means that there is more headspace or space for the steam. This means that you will have a larger supply of steam, higher quality (drier) steam and better temperature stability because it's easier to heat a volume of steam than the same physical volume of water.nA higher water level will reduce the effective amount of steam available and tend to create wet steam as more water gets entrained into the steam. Conversely if your machine sees heavy use for espresso but not steam, you may benefit from a somewhat higher water level which favours water temperature stability.nThe intended water level serves several masters as a espresso machine requires water and steam and of course safety, cost, stability and steam quality in an usable balance. On a single boiler machine you can't really increase the boiler pressure to increase steam power because it would make the machine run too hot for quality espresso extraction. In general, it is desirable to operate single boiler machines on the lower end of the safe water level range for better steaming ability.   nHowever if you have a consumer machine with an inadequately small boiler you may find that lower water levels produce an apparently anemic steam jet. The proper fix for this would be a larger, more capable boiler but pragmatically a higher water level will then produce a more usable steam flow because the entrained water in wet steam has more inertia or force at the expense of less steam capacity and lower quality steam. Or to put it another way in a machine that has too small of a boiler you may need to keep the water level higher to get enough steam power but it will also degrade the steam quality and will make texturing milk more challenging.nn",

As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. nnnI would add to not store it in the refrigerator or freezer.  It would fare better at room temperature and dry than cold where it could be exposed to food smells and moisture.  You didn't ask, but also drink it as soon as possible if it's ground.  Whole beans will keep for awhile but ground coffee will start to go stale very quickly, even if stored properly.nThe National Coffee Association article on How to Store Coffee advises this:  nnIt is important not to refrigerate or freeze your daily supply of coffee because contact with moisture will cause it to deteriorate.  Instead, store coffee in air-tight glass or ceramic containers and keep it in a convenient, but dark and cool, location. Remember that a cabinet near the oven is often too warm, as is a cabinet on an outside wall of your kitchen if it receives heat from a strong afternoon or summer sun.nThe commercial coffee containers that you purchased your coffee in are generally not appropriate for long-term storage. Appropriate coffee storage canisters with an airtight seal are a worthwhile investment.nnAn update to the NCA article adds:nnWhile there are different views on whether or not coffee should be frozen or refrigerated, the main consideration is that coffee absorbs moisture u2013 and odors, and tastes u2013 from the air around it [...]nIf you choose to freeze your coffee, quickly remove as much as you need for no more than a week at a time, and return the rest to the freezer before any condensation forms on the frozen coffee.nnnnRoom temperature, open-air is fine (for a while)n'Microroasted' implies that you purchased the beans where the roasting was done on premises. That means it was probably roasted recently, within a couple of days. Roasts vary, but generally a bean will remain fresh for a week or two, open-air, room temperature from the time of roasting. One person might take two weeks to use a pound of beans. Just keep it in the closed bag, away from temperature extremes.nNo coffee will taste fresh after months, no matter the storage. There are gas-valve tins and bags available online. Coffee beans are quiet dynamic. The chemistry continues long after the roasting heat is removed. The logic behind one-way valves is that fresh-roasted beans continue to release gases that were trapped in the beans. I roast coffee beans and store them in a dark cabinet in a wire basket, exposed to the kitchen air. No bean survives more than 10 days. Most often, the flavor actually improves after a few days.nnnAdding some thinking out of the box to all the great answers, I would say:nYou should not store it, instead try buying less quantity, consistent with your rate of consumption, more often. In this way it's quality will be as near with its production quality.nAs an argument I will point out that oxidization is an effect that can not be prevented easily and once exposed to the atmosphere the coffee interacts with the environment via the moisture it absorbs and all the smells contained within it. That is why Illy seals its containers with Nitrogen to try and isolate it from the environment, as much as possible, till it is opened. nnnThe big killers of coffee taste in roasted coffee beans are:nnmoisture and airborne aromasnoxygennheatnnIn the roasting process the coffee bean doubles in size and gives off most of its moisture content. After roasting the coffee bean becomes super hygroscopic. (i.e. it wants to absorb all the moistures and airborne aromas in the atmosphere that surround it). Oxygen reacts with the delicate coffee oils and turns them rancid, and heat brings the coffee oils to the surface where the oxygen can easily attack it.nSo a completely air-tight container that has not been used to store any other products is a great start. Non porous ceramic or glass is preferred. Make sure light can't penetrate,and it's kept in a cool place away from any heat source. Don't grind it until you plan to use it. While roasted coffee bean quality can be maintained for a few weeks without loss if handled properly, ground coffee can loose significant value within 24 hours. I am no fan of the fridge/freezer option.nnnIn a cool, dry place, away from elements and preferably sealed / vacuum sealednNo paper bags or canvas, something clean, and preferably with one of those moisture wicking buttonsnMy favorite thing is a 'Coffee Vault' from Mystic Monk.  It has two seals and and has a 'lock' to the second seal.  I use to work in a place where you could smell things easily, my coworkers would love it every morning hearing the seal unlock and the vacuum seal taken off as they would smell the coffee as if it was a fresh roasted bag.  Every morning without fail.  I think they are made by AirScape or Planetary Design or something like that.nFor christmas this year my wife got me a Zurich Coffee Vault , which is supposed to be the highest rated and best coffee vault.  Its really good, the coffee scoop I think is a big odd, and I like it, but to me its still nothing compared to the AirScape / Planetary Design Coffee Vault.nI saw no paper bags or canvases, as those are easily affected by the elements and even by the coffee itself, and often what you are given coffee in.  I have found that if you keep the coffee in that, the coffee oils can come off in the bag possibly affecting the next  batch of coffee in that.  Though this is true for anything, even with the Coffee Vaults or plastic storage, if not cleaned properly between uses you will get a different tasting coffee.  The paper and canvas I have also had experiences where the flavor of the canvas or paper starts coming through in the coffee, and I am sure this is also true for some other organic materials.nn",

After much trial and error, I have got to the point where my I am able to make cappuccinos and lattes with a milk texture which is pleasing to taste.nIn order to make the textured milk/microfoam appropriate for a latte, rather than a foamy cappuccino, I had to remove the metal sleeve on the steam wand as this was preventing me from directing the wand precisely enough to swirl it into a microfoam.nHowever, I have the following issues:nnI still can't get a fine enough foam to produce latte art. nMy espresso and its crema do not seem dark enough to produce the contrast in colours you find in good latte art from a cafe. nI cannot seem to get the coffee and the milk to as hot a temperature as you get in a cafe - even if I pre-heat my cup. Could this because many cafes serve their coffee too hot?nnIs it possible that the machine itself is simply not good enough, or do I need to improve my technique? nHere is my latte:nnAnd here is the sort of result I'd like to be able to achieve: nnEDIT: Here is the type of milk pitcher I am using: nnnnI own this machine and have since moved on from it for the exact reasons you stated.nIt is possible to create microfoam that is good enough for making clearly defined latte art on the Delonghi Dedica but it requires practice (as would doing the same on any machine). You did the right thing by removing the metal sleeve but the main problem is that the steam power is relatively weak and so it makes it harder to create the vortex required to properly incorporate the aerated milk. Focus on trying to create a spinning vortex/whirlpool type effect in your milk as this is the most important step in ensuring you end up with silky milk.nnAerate the milk by keeping the tip of the steam wand near the surface of the milk. You should hear spitting noises. This will introduce air into the milk.nOnce you have aerated enough, dip the tip of the steam wand below the surface and try to form a vortex/whirlpool.nSpin the milk as in step 2 until the milk is at the right temperature.nnFor good latte milk, you should not over-aerate. A good starting point is simply raising the height of the milk in your pitcher by about a centimetre. Once again, however, it will require practice and even then it may not be perfect due to the lack of steaming power this machine has.nThe Delonghi Dedica also uses a pressurised portafilter basket which means that the crema you find in your cup is a result of artificial pressures produced inside the basket (similar to how Nespresso machines make their 'crema'). You can attempt to create darker crema by making the pressurised basket not the limiting factor of extraction by grinding finer (but not so fine as to choke the machine).nTemperature-wise, you want to ensure that your portafilter is heated by running empty shots through it as it will cool down the shot as it moves through the portafilter. The steam is also not as hot as commercial machines as they have dedicated boilers for the steaming rather than interchanging between functions within a few seconds like the Delonghi.nIn conclusion, if you enjoy your coffee the way you make it, stick with the Delonghi Dedica but if you put a lot of value in the quality of the crema and being able to pour latte art then you might want to consider an upgrade or investing more time into practicing milk steaming.nnnI've steamed milk on my friend's Saeco Aroma, which seems to be in the same class as your Delonghi, and was able to get good microfoam. Aside from getting some pointers along the way, the key is practice. It took me years to master consistently steamed milk worthy of latte art. You'll probably get something decent if you keep working at it, but then you'll lose it, and you'll go back and forth in that cycle (unless you pick up a job at a coffee shop and make 100 drinks/day). Anyway, here's some pointers to get you started.nnIncorporate as much air as you can until the milk roughly reaches the temperature of your hand (think 95 - 105 F). You're going to need all that air, as the steam wand doesn't have enough power to work with less air. Then dip the  wand for the remainder of the time, trying to fold all those bubbles into the milk. Steam until you can't bare to touch the pitcher anymore, then wait an additional 5-10 seconds (I wait for about 2 seconds on my machine, but yours will take a bit longer).nYou're probably not going to be able to get a vortex going. If you can, great, but if not, it's not the secret to microfoam. It just helps fold the bubbles in.nWhat kind of pitcher are you using? You'll need something with a pointed tip (i.e. don't use one that is marketed for latte art). Here's what I use. Rounded pitchers, like the one at Bed, Bath & Beyond suck!nnI can't really help with the espresso. I've found that to be totally dependent on the machine you have.  You could try Shiri's advice. You could try preinfusion (google it). You could try pulling it shorter, so it doesn't get watered down too much.nHere's a picture of my latte art as credibility.nnnnI have had this exact same machine for about 1 month and am realizing that it is just much more difficult (so far impossible for me) to get art-quality micro-foam out of it for two reasons: n1- Steam is not consistently strong enough, andn2- The wand (after you remove the panarello) is too shortnHowever, it makes tasty espresso, tasty foam (albeit not art quality) and the form-factor and design elements of it is pleasing enough for me to keep it and still enjoy it. nAnyway good luck and please let me know and share your tips if you succeed, as I could leverage your learning. nOn a final note, with a considerable amount of effort, it is possible to swap out the wand for a professional one.

I let it stay for about 5-10min, and it still tastes weaker than coffee made without a coffee filter (paper one of course).nSo my question is, how is a filtered coffee different from unfiltered coffee, assuming we're using a paper filter? Mainly I'm looking for a scientific explanation.nnnIf you want stronger coffee (referring specifically to the amount of total dissolved solids), then you really just need a stronger coffee to water ratio. Or just simply add more coffee. nAlthough what I think you are really experiencing is a difference in mouth feel. Using a paper filter with certainly give the coffee clarity. Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. nThe thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. nI think a good starting place is a 1:16 ratio, meaning 1 parts coffee to 16 parts water. Depending on how that taste to you, just manipulate it until desired. Hopefully this helps out! nnnThere's two points to address.nn'Weaker' coffee with paper filters as compared to brewing right in the cup. As far as I understand (although I can't find citation), paper filter does not capture caffeine or aromatic compounds very much. The feeling that filtered coffee is thinner may in your case come from less microgrounds floating in the cup (i.e., from mechanical, rather than chemical, sensation).nI'm not sure what you meant by carcinogenic properties, but you may want to read about cafestol and kahweol, two diterpines that are supposed to have anti-carcinogenic effect. They are also said to raise cholesterol levels (this study). They are removed by paper filters, and if you want to go into details of its levels in various preparations, see this article. It reports that cafestol is lower in darker roasts, and among the non-filtering methods is highest in swedish boiled coffee and lowest in moka pot ('stovetop espresso').nnn",

It gives the liquid more room to flow.)nnnI tried making cold brew for the first time recently and I just poured the whole mess through the reusable metal screen filter that came with my cheap drip coffee machine. nMy drip machine is the style where the top opens to add both coffee and water sort of like this:nnSo I just put the metal filter in and poured the cold brew straight into the filter allowing the filtered brew to flow into the regular pot below.nIt worked pretty well for the 8 cups or so that I made and it looked like I probably could have gotten away with pouring a bit more. nnnWell this idea was not entirely mine. Some of my senior colleagues gave me this idea a long ways back.nWhen I make Cold Brew, what I do is: nnFirst simply let the coffee grounds steep in the water (no brainer here). nThen, when it's brewed, I use a normal paper coffee filter.nThen I use a very fine piece of silk cloth, thoroughly cleaned, as second filter (after a while you will need to throw away the silk as it will become contaminated and may have a bad flavor). The silk fibers are very thin and fine, so it normally gives me a nice and smooth result.nnnnI have a Bunn airpot brewer and I just take the oversized specialty coffee basket and stick it on top of my french press.  It works ok, but I would like to see better.  Even using this method and having a very large filter, it still gets clogged up after about 4 cups of concentrate, and that's after pre-filtering using the french press filter to get the majority of the grounds out.nI've read that cheesecloth can be used as well, but I have yet to try it.  I may try the french press filter, then filter through wire mesh cone drip, then filter through paper, although this is getting pretty work intensive!nn",

That is: when all other factors are held constant; when used for drip, filter, pour-over, etc. brewing methods when using a paper filter.nThe metrics that I can think of include the following:nnFiltering performance. E.g., Do brown and white filters filter out the same 'stuff'? Do they permit the same rate of water flow? nFlavor of result. E.g., Does one or the other impart off-flavours (e.g., leftovers from whitening, or lack of whitening)? Does does the resulting brewed coffee taste the same?nProduction / environmental issues. E.g., Does it take more energy to produce one or the other? Waste? Chemicals?nnI've tried to read up on this, and most sources seem to indicate that there's no significant difference; it reduces to personal preference, or off-hand environmental claims... but I see nothing concrete.nnMelitta says that they don't use chlorine bleach to whiten paper filters instead using 'oxygen' (which I take to actaully mean 'peroxide', which may be less bad, but I'm not sure). Clicking through also says there's no difference, so maybe I should just accept that;nA discussion on Chow has little more than personal preference;nBasically the same on CoffeeGeek with a 'paper taste' claim about brown filters;nSimilar mild paper-taste conclusion from Reddit.nnnnThere are many difference between the two filters. In this website. it states that:nnToday, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.nnBrown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.nSpeaking of Performance...nIn this website,it states that:nnnNatural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.nWhite : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.nnnAvoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.nTastenYep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:nnMelitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.nnBrown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the website where all the information of this section came from.nEnvironmental ImpactsnWell here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:nnAccording to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since theyu2019re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more u201cgreen,u201d compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.nnPaper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the website that provided the paragraph.nConclusionnNot a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two. I hope this helps you!nn",

But what percentage of that americano would then be 'real coffee'. nnnThis is discussed in many different contexts many times, I assume.

Also, it shows the extraction ratios, a hint of TDS (total dissolved solids) etc. I copy its link just below:nnWhat's the recommended coffee to water ratio for cold brew?nnAs you see, if you can manage to brew an ideal coffee, you can extract only around 20% of the valuable 'essence' from the core of the beans. That's the reason why some of the members of Coffee SE tries to re-brew the used grounds for a second time (I assume), as you can follow below:nnBrewing with the coffee grounds twice?nnThen, of course, some other members discuss the TDS part to find the golden brewing point at the first chart. The easiest way to follow that point repeatedly is done by a refractometer. It is a device that can measure opaqueness.

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! nSo what is the full story? Read on! nnAcidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed CoffeennThese two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour & acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average more acidic than its cold brewed counter part. nnDifferences in Average Flavor ProfilenBut what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? nNo. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. nFor this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  nLet's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: nFull Immersion Cold Brew CoffeennThis is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. nFull Immersion Hot Brew CoffeennThis is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. nAs you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and nacidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.nnDifferences in Flavor Profile by Brewing MethodnFinally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: n(Reminder: Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is not Cold Brew coffee.) nnFull Immersion Cold BrewnnFresh nCO2 DraftnNitrogen Draft nBottled nnIce Drip nnLet's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:nStumptown Draft Cold Brew nn This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. nStumptown Nitro Cold Brew nThis coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. nnThe cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! nnUpdate: Very Short Chemical AnalysisnHow do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?nIt is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). nAlso, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.nAmino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). nThis article is helpful: Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.nn",

Usually, I am provided with a giant tub of Folgers and told I might want to rinse out.  They also give me a little card that says how many 'perks' I'll get out of every cup.nThis is the kind of coffee maker I'm talking about, you put the coffee in a metal hopper in the pod and water splooshes out the middle and burns you when you try to open it:nnI've got 3 coffee makers: I can't remember the exact sizes, but I think they vary between 35 and 100 cups. I usually make a pot of regular in the big one, a pod of decaf in the medium and a backup pot of regular in the small one.  nI am going to purchase big bottles of filtered water for this endeavor and also to get fresh ground beans from a local roaster the night before. nnWhat I really want to know is:nnWhat is the actual cup-to-coffee ratio.  I know 1 Tbsp to 6 OZ and could do the math (But that's like 8 Cups of coffee grounds for 100 cups of water which I believe is chest-hair territory)nGiven the ideal ratio, how far can I deviate before I sink into bathwater territory? nnnnI am a big fan of ignoring volumetric measures and using weight instead.nEspecially for a huge pot like this one, any old kitchen scale should be precise enough to allow a good dosage (for just a cup or two, you need more precision). The general recommendation for filter coffee is nn60g coffee per 1000g water nn(And remember that 1000g =1kg = 1l.)nAs for the 'bath water territory', I admit that I have gone down to '1 heaping teaspoon per mug', which translates to ca. 7g per 200-220g or 30-35g per 1000g. That's pretty close to what aficionados call 'bath water', but I'm sometimes a whimp when it comes to filter coffee. nIf you are dealing with the average crowd of American (weak) coffee drinkers (sorry for bashing the cliche here), I think you can easily go down to 50g/l or even slightly below without the majority even noticing. nBut as you are working with a small local roaster, I suggest you get a small sample beforehand and run a little test. Note that his coffee might (should!) brew differently from the supermarket sawdust. You might want to choose the right roast if you're going to lower the ratio. Tlk to your roaster: Factors that should be kept in mind are the type of machine and the fact that the water will probably be very hot, so the selected roast should be able to withstand it somewhat.nAlso, the grind will be important, but 'medium' should be a good starting point. If your machine needs coarser grounds, you will have to increase the coffee by 5-10% to get the same result.nFinally, even if you did some test runs at home and think you perfected every parameter, that kind of machine you will be using is not designed to maximize the coffee quality, but the output - that's just how it is. The results should still be significantly better than 'get a few cans of [you know which brands] and boil them to death with chlorinated water'. Most of your guests will enjoy the fu00eate and the community and pay only little attention to the coffee - they will taste your effort and appreciate your dedication nevertheless.n(And if you do all that to make sure you can have a decent cup of coffee at the festival, I still think that's worth it!)nn",

Basically, you prepare brewed coffee as you normally would, only you use half hot water, half ice you put in the bottom of the vessel. The hot, fresh coffee drips directly onto ice so that itu2019s cool and ready to drink right away.nnI've now tried it a few times using my small chemex and a ratio of 2:1 (water to ice) rather than 50:50. I'm trying the pour over much more slowly than I normally would to maximise the extraction while using less water.nI can't really fault the taste, the flavour is still great, the finish is less acidic but obviously more watery. So while this method is indeed quick and uncomplicated I'm curious about 2 things:nnWhat else can I do to compensate for the extraction difference? I would really prefer it to be less watery.nAm I potentially going to crack the pot with the combination of hot and cold? I can't find any info on temperature variances on the Chemex site. nnEdited to add information...nFor a hot-brew I normally use  using 300ml hot water for 21g of grind. Here I'm using 200ml hot water in the pour over, to compensate for the 100g of ice that melts. nI'm taking 6-7 minutes with the pour. Normally I would take 3 minutes.nI'm making my grind slightly finer in order to extend time it takes the water to drip through. I would consider it to be medium-fine. nnnWhat you're talking about is the 'Japanese iced coffee' method, which is hot-water brew directly over ice. In contrast, cold-brew is using cold water in contact with the grounds. See techniques at other questions tagged as cold-brew.nThis article from Counter Culture, also referenced in the article you linked, suggest Japanese iced as an alternative to cold brew. The articles suggest that directly brewing hot coffee over ice retains more of the volatile flavour compounds.nIf you have had true cold-brew before, most methods use several times as much coffee grounds to brew as with other methods (some then dilute this with, e.g., water or milk). For example, normalized to a 200mL 'cup' (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for cold brew (45g per 200mL) than for drip (14g per 200mL). If you're coming from that strength, it's no wonder you're finding it watery. nTo your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not simply use more coffee grounds? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose. But if you want it stronger, use more beans!nOn your other question: this temperature change shouldn't be an issue. You said you're using a Chemex (e.g., classic 3-cup) -- it is made from Pyrex brand borosilicate glass, which has very good thermal shock properties. Even a lesser glass (e.g., non-tempered soda-lime glass) shouldn't be a problem at these temperatures (slowly dripping boiling water onto ice). (However, for example, ice into glass at oven temperatures could certainly be a problem).nnnWhen I hear 'cold brew' I think something like Dutch Coffee, or coffee brewed with cold water and long extraction times. Acidity likely wouldn't be reduced by cooling the coffee directly after, it's possible that the melted ice is just diluting your brew and cooler temperature mellows out the taste of the acidity.nThere are many ways of cold brewing. Some involve full immersion for a long extraction time, like Toddy. Others slowly drip cold water or ice melt into grounds using a drip tower. The second method is often prefered and offers the most balanced extraction. However, I've had Toddy before and it does alright. Toddy might be the less expensive method, but for a plastic bin and some big paper filters I feel like a drip tower is better worth the money if you can find one for a reasonable price. You can find some drip tower/dutch coffee makers on ebay in the $90 range.nAs far as I'm concerned, however, you are not cold brewing. You're just making iced coffee. I do something similar with an Aeropress. The Aeropress I would prefer for iced coffee, as it brews a concentrate. I've noticed little difference in acidity, it may seem more mild simply because it's cold and acids tend to mellow out at cooler temperatures, but once ingested its all the same(hot or cold) if you're trying to ward of acid reflux or similar. Cold brewing would actually make the coffee less acidic, rather than just mellowing out the taste of acidity.nIf you're interested in trying the Aeropress method, I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy iced coffee. You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool. This method produces iced coffee in the same amount of time it takes to make a hot cup of coffee with the Aeropress(1-5min), without diluting the coffee. It accomplishes basically what you're intending to do, but with the aeropress rather than the chemex. This method will take less time, produce a stronger cup, and is a bit cheaper(the aeropress is pretty cheap). You can brew a cup when you want it, rather than prepping coffee ahead of time.nnnEver considered cooling your coffee down to 40 degrees immediately after you brew it? This would keep the freshness as well as not dilute it. Check out this link.nn",

Obviously JavaScript has almost nothing to do with coffee, but the author maintained a coffee barista metaphor throughout the book and stated that allongu00e9 is some coffee variant. So for the uninitiated coffee drinkers out there among his readers, can you explain what an allongu00e9 is, what makes it unique, and how to actually pronounce it? nThe author does offer a brief description quoted from Caffe Molinari linked here, but as a coffee newbie much of what is being described escapes me. Here is the quoted text from Braithwaite's preface:nnu201cCafu00e9 Allongu00e9, also called Espresso Lungo, is a drink midway betweenn  an Espresso and Americano in strength. There are two different ways ton  make it. The first, and the one I prefer, is to add a small amount ofn  hot water to a double or quadruple Espresso Ristretto. Like adding an  splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of then  complex flavours in the mouth.nu201cThe second way is to pull an extra long double shot of Espresso. Thisn  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilutionn  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to then  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter andn  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel itn  releases even more complexity.nu201cThe important thing is that neither method of preparation should usen  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.n  Moderation in all things.u201dnnnnCafu00e9 allongu00e9 is the French for Italian cafe lungo, or in English, long espresso.nThere may be previous related answers on this:nnI run my espresso machine until my whole cup is full. What's my coffee called?nWhat are the standard espresso parameters (dose, mass/volume, time, etc.)?nAnd, of course a wiki page.nnI don't know how to write in the pronounciation alphabet, but it is pronounced something similar to 'a-lawn-jee'.nNormally, it is prepared in a bit longer time than normal espresso. So, the second explanation given in the book is the standard way.nThe first one is more sophisticated and uncommon with many side flavors in it. People who are into coffee mostly prefer pure coffee. However, as the author likes it that way, probably he uses such a metaphor in his book.n(As computer scientists know, JavaScript is dynamically typed which may cause many undesirable side effects according to the type theory. I assume, the second recipe is more suitable to be used as a metaphor for a programming language that has type system. Haskell maybe?)nnnyou've got your answer about what it is , but the pronunciation is more like :nah (don't pronounce the h , it's used here for the 'a' sound)nlon (like long , without the 'g')nthere's an accent on the 'e' at the end, so it's an 'ay' sound, as in 'day'nAlso, the g is pronounced with something between a 'sh' and a 'j' sound.nnnYou can hear it here and see the English translation:nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=allong%C3%A9&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8nnnRegarding pronunciation, I speak French (my primary language) and allongu00e9 would be said like this:nAh-lon-jaynn",

Is there any way to verify, quantify, or otherwise substantiate that claim, or is it superstition?nnnI can say, by experience, that it's not a superstition. Maybe not seconds, but for sure it's just a few minutes.nMaybe someone could find a reference to an experiment or I may encounter and add it later. But, you can easily observe it by your nose.nThe aromatic components are the source of the flavor in coffee beans. When you ground them, you crack them fine. The components get free and start to evaporate. That's why you can smell them. However, we want to taste them so badly. So, we need to trap then into the water as quick as possible, before most of them evaporate.nnBelow is a nice chart that shows how quickly coffee goes stale when it's stored as whole beans. Ground coffee, I assume, would be similar, but so much quicker as the surface area is greater for evaporation this time.nWhen does coffee go off?nnnThe only way to verify that claim is by your own senses: flavour and taste in the cup. these are both very subjective, I might be a superficial espresso drinker but for me some good fresh ground beans last at least 3 days if kept sealed and in the fridge.nGround Coffee has the tendency to absorb every oder odor in the fridge or wherever is kept (in fact one of last uses of stale or unused coffee is has a natural odor eater), so the way it is sealed is very important. Majority of ground coffee seller (Lavazza, Segafreddo, etc.) they vacuum the pack removing almost all the air (check the pack should be hard as a rock before you buy it otherwise the sealing is gone), they claim coffee will stay good even for years - again, it all comes down to what you do with it: if it is moka brew I have had it all my life and most of the times is acceptable, for espresso it is not even ground properly so I never tried.nThe only exception to this is Illi sealing, which is packed in nitrogen modified atmosphere I find this ground coffee to be one of the best so far, when you open the pack your do feel the same aroma of fresh ground coffee, I wish they would sell it in an espresso grinding setting (I know it is difficult) to see how it would come out. I regularly buy the decaffeinated version which is ground finer and which I use to make the once-in-a-while-decaf with my oscar.nUPDATEnLast month I started freezing (deep freezing, at least -20) ground coffee inside sealed jars, the result is amazing: nThere is no 'stale' odor when you open the jar after a week or so: actually no flavor at all, I was expecting it to aggregate into bigger chunks or to develop some kind compactness but no, it is thin as it used to be;nThe magic happens when you put it inside a warmed up portafilter, just before pulling the shot: you can feel everything is coming back to life and the espresso is just as it used to be: visually the crema is the same, taste-wise it seems there is more acidity, but I could be wrong and it could be happening only with this variety of beans (100% arabica, almost medium roast) nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I just had an espresso at a cafu00e9, and it really put into perspective how weak my everyday coffee is. All the equipment I own is a blade grinder, and my method is a turkish brew (grind the beans, put them in the cup, pour-over some boiling water, wait for it to sink, done!).nWhat can I do to get stronger coffee? And more precisely, what will make the most difference?nNote that I am not willing to buy any new equipment or machines; I'm asking about what I can do with what I've got.nUpdate: tried adding grounds onto boiling water, instead of pouring water over grounds. Here's how it went:nTL;DR: nn No success, strength did not increase and taste just got worse.nnWhat I did: nI took my strongest beans, ground them as fine as possible, used two identical cups, divided the grounds into two equal portions (on a separate tray). I put grounds first, boiling water afterwards in the first cup, and did the same thing but backwards on the second one. I did not stir any of the cups after adding all ingredients. After quite some time I tasted both cups, I am now finishing them both up while programming.nObservations:nThe grounds on the 'water-first' cup took a considerable time to sink into the liquid. Even after the brewing time had passed, much more grounds were floating around there than in the 'pour-over' cup. Also, the water-first cup had almost no foam, which the pour-over cup had plenty of.nResults:nThe water-first cup was not stronger than the pour-over; if anything it tasted weaker. The taste was quite different too, water-first tasted a bit stale/watery (not much but there was a clear difference). Pour-over had a rounder and more full aroma, liked that one more. And the crema/foam looked a lot better on the pour-over as well.nnnThere are a few things you can do.n1) More beans.  More beans = more surface area = more extraction.n2) Grind finer.  It's tough to control grind size with a blade grinder, so if you really want a consistent, strong cup, you will eventually want to invest in a burr grinder.  But with a blade grinder, grind it longer.n3) This is the biggest: don't use boiling water. Optimal coffee extraction occurs at temperatures roughly between 185 and 202 degrees F.  You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.  I find that, in North Carolina, the best temperature is on the higher end of that range, from 195 to 200 degrees.n4) Finally, don't stir with a metal spoon during extraction.  Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.  The cream is basic and will help neutralize the acid.nnnI see only one possibility to make your turkish brew stronger and that is using more coffee beans per serving. You are using boiling water and long extraction time so almost everything from the coffee gets extracted leaving you this only option to make it stronger.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "How much impact has having a coffee bag being opened vs. sealed on preserving the aroma of beans over 1 month?nI am deliberating between 250 gram and 500 gram packages, with the former being 4% more expensive per kilo then the latter.n250 grams lasts me about a month (allows for one 8-gram espresso equivalent every day), so buying the larger bag, in the second month I would be using beans which are stored one month longer in a opened bag then if I would be buying the smaller bag.nDoes it make sense to opt for the smaller 1-month bags in this usage pattern, or is the difference going to be infinitesimal?nnnTrading off taste difference against price depends on how much each of them matters to you.nStoring an open bag of beans in the cabinet for 8 weeks probably does matter to taste, while a 4% price difference is easily in the noise.nTaste DifferencenIt seems fair to assume you care about taste differences since you're asking. So for that side of the comparison, itu2019s sufficient to ask whether you can taste any difference, and thatu2019s fun and easy to test. See this answer on how to do a triangle test.nHere's an experimental design for coffee bean storage duration: Weigh out the coffee into small plastic bags, put half the bags in the freezer and half the bags in the cabinet, then at different durations, defrost a frozen bag while still sealed (so the beans don't get water condensation from the air), and compare the coffee it makes against a bag from the cabinet. I did this with medium roast beans listed as u201chigh bodyu201d and u201cbold acidityu201d so degradation would be readily noticeable.nAfter 2 days, we could not distinguish the frozen from cabinet-stored beans. (That rules out the hypothesis that freezing hurts beans, at least when defrosted in the bag.) After 4 weeks, we still could not distinguish them. After 12 weeks, all tasters could tell, and with high confidence.nCaveats: That was just one kind of bean, made just one way, with 5 tasters who are no cross-section of the worldu2019s population. But each taste test got u201cstatistically significantu201d results for a hypothesis picked in advance. Good enough for me.nI doubled the duration between each test, hence I didn't test 8 weeks. The taste impact of 8 weeks storage is still in play. Do try the test at 4 and 8 weeks with your favorite coffee. For discussionu2019s sake, letu2019s call it likely.nSide note: If you want to stretch out the freshness of a 2 month supply, itu2019s viable to freeze some of it in small bags.nPrice DifferencenPerception studies have a notion of u201cjust noticeable differenceu201d (JND). A smaller difference than that is unlikely to be noticeable (not the same as u201cmeasurableu201d). A starting assumption for a new domain is JND = 1dB (as it is for audio volume) which is about 26%, but a quick web search gets us a JND threshold for price from Marketing As I know it:nnWhy is it a 10% off sale fails to get your attention while a 50% off sale brings in consumers from the surrounding counties?n  The reason the 10% sale does not excite is that it is below the JND. Research has proven that the JND for price tends to be between 20 to 25%. nnIn context, a % comparison (whatever the percentage amount) assumes you have a budget or reference in mind for that expense. If the % difference blows your coffee budget, you could compensate by drinking less often, or better yet by making more of your coffee at home than from cafes. If you think of coffee as part of your overall food & drink budget, maybe you could make up a large price difference by drinking less soda or eating less meat (both of which are health and environmental improvements).nnnPerhaps a better way to frame your question is to ask if you are willing to pay an extra 4% to have coffee fresher by one month.  For me that's an easy one - absolutely I would pay an extra 4% to have fresher coffee.  nThere are all kinds of opinions about how long freshly roasted coffee maintains its freshness, but I've never seen anyone opine that roasted coffee beans can stay fresh for over one month without a noticeable decline in taste.  I home roast my coffee and it rarely gets to be over two weeks old before it's gone.  But ultimately that's a question for you and your taste buds and your wallet.nn",

Why did pre-modern societies roast and drink it up, considering the notion that coffee is basically bitter? I mean, if Turkish elites roasted it dark and drank it immediately afterwards, wouldn't that be rather tasteless and overly bitter?nDid people drink it for the caffeine? Or did they actually like it for its flavor?nI'd just like to hear out some of your insights and the things you've read on coffee's history and coffee in past societies. I'll research on the things you say, and fish some inspiration. nnnA story often shared as the origin of coffee consumption is that of Kaldi and The Dancing Goats, which comes out of Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee.nKaldi was a herder who discovered his goats would become rambunctious after eating the berries and leaves of a plant. That plant turned out to be the coffee plant.nUpon observing this, Kaldi also partook of the plant's berries, finding it gave him extra energy. Some claim people would crush the berries and mix them with animal fat into rudimentary 'protein bars'.nEventually they began drying-out the berries and steeping the seeds (beans) in hot water to brew the first coffee to grace the Earth. Thus begins the storied history of coffee consumption!nnAnother anecdote relating to coffee involves Pope Clement VIII. His advisors urged him to ban the consumption of coffee, likening it to the 'Devil's brew' as it was popular among Muslims.nHowever, after tasting coffee for the first time, the Pope was so impressed he couldn't bare to think of outlawing it. It's said this led to the spread of coffee drinking among Catholics and Italians in general.nThis story should be taken with a grain of salt, as whether or not Pope Clement VIII actually said or did what he said, or whether or not his advisors ever broached the topic is a matter of speculation.nThat said, there are many more stories surrounding the spread and popularization of coffee. I'll let others add their own stories, as I know there are many more out there :)nnnOne interesting story is Ottoman Sultan Murat IV banned coffee consumption in Istanbul in between 1632 to 1640.nThe reason is simple, the people were sitting in 'kahvehane's (the coffeehouses) of Istanbul and discussing politics. He wants to stop people discussing himself, easiest way to stop discussions were getting rid of social areas at all which was coffeehouses back then.nTogether with coffee, he also banned, smoking and alcohol. Ironically, Murat IV died at 28 as a result of alcohol poisoning.nnnAnother interesting one is the story of the first coffee house in Vienna. It starts with the siege of Vienna by the Ottomans in the end of the 16th century.nJerzy Franciszek Kulczycki is a Polish/Ukranian man who is now regarded as a hero and known as the owner of the first coffee house of Vienna. Probably, the inventor of cappuccino.nHe was a very fluent speaker in many languages including Ottoman Turkish. During the siege, he is used by the city as a messenger and saved the city in the last day by carrying a critical message by disguising as a janisary (Ottoman soldier) when the city were about the leave the city to the Ottomans.nAfter the siege, he opens the Europe's third and Vienne's first coffee house with the sacks of coffee beans left by the Ottoman army u2014which was now retreating and leaving all the heavy stuff behind on the way back home. This was probably one of the first encounters of Europeans to coffee.nKulczycki's friend Marco du2019Aviano who was a Cappuchin monk, thought coffee is quite bitter and choose to add honey and milk into it. When milk added, coffee changed its color from black to brown and looks more like Cappuchin monks traditional robe's color. Kulczycki, named that kind of sweetened coffee after his monk friend.nRight after Kulczycki became known, he even started to wear janisary clothes in his coffeehouse while serving coffee. His monuments are still around Vienna. You can check his Wikipedia page here.nnnWell, people have an addiction nowadays. However if one drinks good coffee in good periods, this can even been count as energizer and sleep aborter. Back on that days, I think people found unique ways to make it. Cook, boil or just eat its seeds without any refinement. nI would contribute Turkish coffee's bitterness by telling about a tradition here in TR. nWhen a couple decides to get married, groom's family heads to bride's parents' home. With a flower, and a chocolate. (Prefferably put in a silver gondol vase. Then girl serves Turkish cofee to everyone in the room. Starting by elders. Traditionally, if the girl does like dude, she puts some salt in it. That is the way to make sure if he can tolerate any jokes or not. nn",

This means I have to grind the beans.nI have a cheap spice grinder that does a great job at preparing the beans into ground coffee. It is easy to use, takes 5-15 seconds to process half a dozen cups worth of beans, and I have  good control over how fine a powder to make the beans into. I'm pretty sure this is a similar story for almost everyone with an electric grinder.nI saw a friend using a hand grinder. It took far longer and from what I saw there was no discernable difference between hand ground coffee and machine ground coffee in terms of texture (if anything the texture was less consistent when hand ground).nGiven this, why on earth would anyone want to hand grind?nnnHand grinders will work without electricity.  nYou can generally get a conical hand grinder cheaper than you can get an electric one.  nThey also create less noise than a electric grinder.nHand grinders will generally produce less heat than an electric (may affect bean flavor).nMany grinders are lighter and smaller than electric ones. They are portable and can easily be packed for use when traveling.nAs to the consistency, a conical grinder (electric or manual) will generally create a more consistent grind than a electric blade 'grinder'.  Electric blade grinders tend to produce dust and boulders.  I know because I use one at work daily and I can see the inconsistency in the grind, but it doesn't bother me that much.  At home, my burr grinder creates a much more consistent grind.nnnWhen grinding coffee, the particle size of the resulting powder can be described with a bell curve, whose width (and thus, the powder consistency) varies on mostly the roast and the grinding method. A manual grinder with adjustable grinding size will produce a more consistence powder, whereas electric grinders (especially the cheaper household ones) will provide you with a wider curve with less guaranteed consistency.nThe roast however has a much smaller say in the consistency, but beans roasted darker may tend to give you a bit more percentage of fine powder as the beans dry out more and become more fragile.nAnd I won't even mention how the manual grinding can become part of someone's morning workout routine...nnnThough it may not result in any substantial difference in the coffee, hand grinding provides a more analog experience. Speaking just for my self, I enjoy the hands on approach. It certainly takes more time than an electric grinder, but if you're just grinding for a single cup of French Press or Areopress, it's not that much longer.nIn general, though, a burr grinder is much better than a blade grinder. It gives you a more even grind, which allows for better extraction. A decent electric burr grinder costs at least $130. You can get a good hand grinder for about half that. For many people, the cost factor is the important one.nnnYour question has the statement that your blade grinder results in grounds that are equal or superior to the hand grinder in terms of texture.  This is generally not true.  There was a time when I would have agreed with you until a change in my brew method showed me otherwise.  When using my Aeropress inverted, when I began to allow the grounds to extract longer, the large fragments separated from the finer powder and rose to the top of the brew.  They became visible and when I dumped the extracted grounds out onto a paper towel, I was shocked at how many very large - including a few whole beans - there were in the spent grounds.  One side of the spent puck had very fine powder and the other much larger fragments.  nHaving learned (from this site) that different flavor profiles from the bean extract at different rates, I could see how a consistent grind would result in a more consistent flavor profile.  I should also say that when I use my blade grinder, looking at the dry grounds, these large fragments aren't visible at all!  It's only when they are allowed to separate while brewing that they are obvious.  I would also add that I own one of the higer rated blade grinders out there. nnnMaybe your friend is sensitive to noise. I'm sure you noticed that hand grinding doesn't product that deafening noise that most electric grinders create. That being said, I find that the only time that I ever use one is when I'm out camping.nnnIf nothing else, in the morning, the extra work wakes you up a bit more. It's also one less electrical socket used.nOne thing I notice is that different beans and roasts actually feel different while you're hand-grinding. nnnIt's part of the ritual of coffee, which should not be underestimated. nnA little later I would hear bell-like notes as someone pounded coffeen  in a brass mortar, varying his strong to produce the semblance of an  tune. Thesiger, Arabian Sands.nnAnd personally, I enjoy making coffee for my wife or for my guests, so hand-griding the beans makes the gesture more significant.nn",

We do have one of those taps that chills water, would that be good enough?nnnI have no specific experience with this cold brew device but a general understanding of how extraction works and experience with other devices. In short, you can definitely use water at room temperature to make cold brew (I think it is better), but there seem to be some specific issues with this cold brew maker.nIn general the colder the water, the slower it will extract the solid compounds from the coffee. This is the main thing you have to keep in mind, because you will have to adjust some other variables in order to reach the right extraction. In their instructions they suggest you use a medium grind level. This is one variable you could change. Instead of a medium grind level I would use a medium to coarse grind. Another variable that you could change is the brew time. They set the device to 1 drop per second but you could increase that a little to speed up the brewing process, resulting in less extraction.nSpecifically with this device there seems to be the problem, that air bubbles block the valve (see the FAQ on the website). They argue that the changing water temperature is responsible for the bubbles to appear. However if you brew at room temperature the water temperature should be much more consistent than with ice water which will obviously melt eventually and then the water will warm up. So I'm not quite sure about their logic (unless you are supposed to add ice until the brewing is over).nI suggest you go ahead and try it at room temperature, adjusting the other variables. Make sure you pre infuse properly so the grounds degas as much as possible, that should prevent too much gas blocking the valve. Alternatively you could use refrigerated water and brew it in the fridge.nHope this helps, in the end it's a lot of trial and error anyways. Have fun brewing.nn",

Is their any way to brew coffee so that it isn't so acidic?nnnThere are at least three ways to reduce acidity.nOne way is to roast the beans more, to a dark level. I think that is the main way if you want to stick with your beans. This is inline with MT San's comment and related answer.nA second way is to play with the speed of dripping. The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.nAn alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.nThere may be other ways, but I have no other experience.nLater...nThanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to 'drip-brew', so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.nCold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results. And warming up the result leads to yet again different flavours.nIn my experience, drinks are less acid with coffee brew. I do not use a wide range of beans, so please keep in mind that this claim may depend on the species. Also, the roast level leads to different results---exactly as a hot-water drip does.nCold brew emphasizes 'green' or 'herbal' notes, though. It is, I believe, worth a try as acidity is different, but it is yet different from 'usual coffee drinks'. Well, production is hard too.nnnIf you are simply looking for less acidic beans (rather than changing your brew method), you may check into finding coffee that was dry processed and then dark roasted.  Darker roasts will have less acidity than a lighter roast (a fairly well established truism).  However, processing method is a huge factor in affecting the flavor of coffee.  Wet and pulp methods are aimed at increasing the 'brightness' and high notes in coffee, which generally means more acidity.  Dry process tends to enhance the body of coffee at the expense of brightness (less acidity).  It is very hard to directly compare flavor profiles from process methods since they tend to be very distinct by region and it's hard to find coffees that are from the same areas, but processed differently.  Dry process will not work well in a wet/humid region; it will actually produce sub standard coffee.  nIf you are willing to change your brew method, as suggested elsewhere, cold brew may also be a way to go.nn",

I'm thinking that making large batches by steeping coffee in big mesh tea bags will be the easiest upgrade. I'm also assuming that a secondary filtration will be necessary, but that's a separate question.nWhat sort of mesh sizes and materials are best for balancing yield with how fine the filtration is? nThanks! nnnI have had bags made up in China. 30cm x 30cm 100 micron is best for stepping.

I am using an espresso machine. Should I clean the machine extra well? How about the grinder?nnnEach coffee has it's own special taste and distinctive flavours. Whether it is pre-ground Maxwell House or small-batch roasted single origin, there will be different flavour profiles and smells. nThe 'quality' of coffee is mostly determined by the bitterness and taste. Fresh, great quality coffee is often bright and has complex flavours that fill your palette. Diner coffee is usually bland and more bitter. nIn high-quality beans, the enjoyment of the coffee is then more down to personal taste. That is, whether someone likes a bright, almost tea-like single origin from Ethiopia, or a deep-bodied Sumatran coffee with herbal notes.nThis Kopi Luwak coffee will certainly have it's own distinctive taste, that's for sure. Will it taste better than cheap coffee like Maxwell house? Yes, probably. Will it be the best coffee you've ever had? Maybe not, and that is just fine. People drink this coffee because it is rare and sought after, not neccesarily because they are looking for the best cup.nAs for brewing it, I would suggest trying it a number of ways, because each brewing method brings out different flavour profiles. French press will allow you to experience the body that is likely from a South-east asian coffee and will allow the natural oils onto your palette. Pour-over will take away some of that body but accentuate the herbal tones and bring out the top-end in terms of flavours. Espresso is always interesting, and the concentrated method could yield some surprising flavours.nIf you have the means to try it, I would. It's a neat experience and if you are keen on coffee, tasting more coffee, no matter where its from, is always a good thing.nAs for cleaning your equipment, just make sure to do a regular cleaning of your espresso machine/french press to remove any residue. This doesn't have to be intensive, just make sure there are no leftover grounds. For you grinder, I would disassemble as much as possible and wash and dry the parts. Grinders always retain a decent amount of grounds, and those mixing in with the expensive Kopi Luwat could change the flavour.nHere are three videos where people try this coffee:nTestednTravel Blogger??nNews AnchornHope this helps!nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I love the smell of coffee. I enjoy eating coffee chocolate. However I am unable to drink straight coffee, because it is so unbearably bitter for me.nObviously, no-one is compelled to drink coffee - and I'm perfectly fine without it. However so many people enjoy this drink so much, and it would be nice if I could experience the same pleasure. The fact that I like the flavour of coffee (as when eating a coffee-flavoured sweet) tells me that if only I could find a variety of the drink which did not include the bitterness, then I would enjoy it.nI have asked this question of several people over the years, who have suggested that I try lattu00e9, for example - however the fact that the coffee is diluted by a large amount of milk does not solve the problem. It means less flavour - and yes, less bitterness - but the bitterness is still there.nThe other day I was recommended to try an Ethiopian coffee called Bukeela. I was told that this was especially weak, and that I might be able to take it. So.. I tried it. I added lots of sugar. However it was still too much for me. Yes, the coffee was weak - but that just meant that the flavour was weaker. The bitterness was still present, and still made me unable to drink it. The sugar did not help. It simply meant that I had two tastes in my mouth simultaneously: sweet: but still bitter.nEdit: the related question on this site regarding 'sweet coffee' does not address my question. Sweetness isn't the same thing as non-bitterness. As stated here, even if I add lots of sugar, I just get 2 tastes simultaneously: sweet and bitter. The bitterness is still there. That other question doesn't mention bitterness at all.nIt seems that my taste buds are especially sensitive to anything bitter. I can not drink beer, and I dislike certain vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, because of their bitterness.nSo the question for all you coffee experts is: does there exist a variety of coffee which retains the yummy flavour, but which has no trace of the unpalatable bitterness?nnngreat question.nThere are a few factors that will give your coffee the flavor and such that you want.  To fully answer your question, we also need to understand some of your preferences and the answer may change slightly depending on your those.  nOne General question is when you say 'bitterness', do you mean 'acidity' of the bean, or potentially a taste associated with the water (hard or soft water taste, possibly acidic water or akaline water)?  You may not know or be able to pinpoint what I mean.  I get two different flavor results from when I brew at work versus when I brew at home in the same french press with the same beans. nI personally find that some of the bitterness is caused by the process of brewing, which has a few factors.nI personally enjoy the French Press, which not everyone has the availability or patience to do that.  I found that the French Press makes the taste stronger, but less bitter, and I can dial back the strength of the flavor based on the amount I use in the french press.nAlong those lines, the water you use can make a HUGE difference as well.  I try to make sure my water is always purified and from a clean container, and that the temperature is not too hot (personally between 180-190).  I worked at one place that had Keurigs, and some of them had the water container on the side.  I would have to wash those out and flush out the water inside before I got a 'clean' non-bitter tasting cup of coffee, although they were used all day.  The company eventually switched to having an in-line water supply and filter for the Keurigs which greatly helped (when the water filter was clean).  Another company I worked for only had the 'Bunn-O-Matic' and the bitterness was also caused by a build up of calcium inside the brewer as well as too hot of water (200F+).  I adjusted both of those things and would clean out the brewer weekly and people flocked to the coffee station after that.nCoffee type I think can be a factor depending on your method and your preference as well.  A few friends like lighter roasts so they don't get the acidity of the roast / coffee, which they consider to be the bitterness.  Some of those friends will also swear by 'flavored' beans/grounds, as typically those are lighter roasts and the flavor will some of that bitterness they are referring to.  nI have also tried Mystic Monk Coffee and I find them to not be bitter for both their regular blends and their flavored blends.nLast suggestion, I have another friend and his wife both love Columbian coffee because of the flavor and it doesn't have the acidity, but it has some bitterness with the coffee flavor. nnnTo answer this shortly, no there is no coffee that has no bitterness. Bitterness in coffee is determined by different factors on which I will elaborate a bit now.nFirst of all there are bitter substances naturally in coffee. The most obvious and widely known one would be caffein. However in truth only around 15% of the bitterness in coffee comes from caffein. There are hundreds of active substances in coffee, some of which are bitter. Most importantly are chlorogenic acids. They contribute most to the bitterness. So it is unlikely that you will ever find a coffee that has no trace of bitterness at all.nThere are however some influenceable factors that contribute to bitterness. I want to address first the roasting process, bean type and origins and then preparation methods and some tweaks that might help.n 1. RoastingnAs I've said before, key to how bitter coffee tastes are the kind of chemical compounds found in it. And the roasting process determines exactly this. When the beans are heated chlorogenic acids are broken down into first acid lactones and later in the roast process into phenylindanes. Chlorogenic acid itself is not bitter, but the compounds it breaks down into are and especially phenylindanes. As they appear later in the roasting, darker roasts tend to be more bitter than light roasts. So my advice here would be to try very light roasted beans. Here's another source that also refers to some of the other points I'm making.n2. Bean type and originnThere are two main types of Beans, Arabica and Robusta with Robusta containing both much more caffein as well as chlorogenic acids. Thus stay clear of Robusta or mixed coffees, since it will add extra bitterness to your cup. Also in my experience light roasted african coffees, e.g. ethiopean or kenyan coffees are the mildest coffees when it comes to bitterness, but do have more acidity than central or south american coffees. n3. Preparation methodsnFirst of all, avoid espresso. Because of the pressure applied to the coffee much more bitter compounds are extracted. A general rule of thumb is that with higher extraction you will extract more bitter compounds, that quickly dominate the flavor of the coffee. The bitter compounds are usually extracted at later stages of the extraction process, thus the shorter your extraction the less bitterness. I would suggest you try pour overs, as extraction can be controlled very well and they are just by design made for a cup of coffee with a brighter, more acidic flavor. V60 or even better a Chemex are your best options. The thick Chemex paper will filter more of the bitter compounds and leave more of the acidic, fruity, floral flavors. There are plenty of instructions on youtube or also here in the forum. Avoid overextraction due to a too small grind size, too high water-grounds contact time and too hot water (around 94u00b0C would be perfect, you can go a bit lower however). Additionally make sure you have a good grinder that produces a consistent particle size. If the variation is too big (the downward variation in this case) and if the grinder produces too many fines (very small coffee particles), they will be over extracted and add bitterness.n4. Possible tweaksnnAdding a pinch of salt to your coffee reduces bitterness.nUse freshly roasted whole bean coffee from your local specialty coffee shop (you can recognize them because they usually offer a variety of pour over methods and have a generally kind of hipstery look) as preground packs of coffee tend to be over-roasted to mask the low quality.nGrind fresh, with a good grinder and even filter out the fines (just sift it through a fine mesh filter)nLastly you could look for a specialty coffee shop that offers whole light roasted decaf beans. Although caffein only plays a secondary role, it still is bitter and removing it might help reduce bitterness.nOf course there are other factors such as the water for example. However the answers there are not as straightforward and the influence arguably less than the above mentioned ones.nnI hope this can help you in your quest for finding a coffee that you like. I suggest you also go to some local roasters and talk to them. They might be able to help you, suggest coffees etc. and who knows, maybe you can even interest one of them in experimenting with roast profiles that minimize bitterness.nnnWhen reading about coffee roasting and searching around for espresso brewing, I have over the years learned that extracting coffee for too long will add bitterness to the coffee.nMy experience also tells me that the roast of the particular bean makes a big difference in the bitterness. Currently, I roast Costa Rica Tarazzu Cumbre halfway between the first and second crack and do not find bitterness in my cup.nI started in the wrong order and bought an espresso machine as the first part but didn't find the coffee I liked. Then I bought a grinder (Rocky) but still didn't find what I was looking for. Lastly, I got a roaster and the magic showed.nBasically, once you start roasting your beans, you will find that you will get the truest coffee taste and least bitterness. From here on, it is a matter of finding the bean that is your favorite. The above mentioned is surely one of the least bitters I have had.nnnYou can reduce the bitterness of coffee, but maybe not to a level that you'll like.n(One friend said he couldn't stand bell peppers, explaining that if they tasted 10x as strong, I probably wouldn't like them, either. I've since asked people if there's a particular flavor they don't like, and heard a variety of surprising responses.)nJudging by the coffee at many cafes, lots of people must not mind bitter coffee or covering it up with sugar and cream. I think good coffee should be good black.nIt's possible to buy tasty 100% dark chocolate from some artisan chocolate makers. They have to start with suitable beans and use well-tuned processes. Sloppy won't cut it.nSimilarly, it is possible to make coffee that's not (very) bitter. It requires selecting suitable beans and applying a good process.nI don't know how to find suitable beans in general, but try 100% Kona coffee. (If it doesn't say u201c100%u201d then itu2019s heavily diluted.) I've found some other excellent beans from Mexico and Colombia. I think all of these were medium roast.nBrewing technique is critical. Try using an AeroPress because it gives lots of control over the brewing variables, it limits extraction by brewing with a portion of the water (dilute it after brewing), and immersion methods are more forgiving.nThis page on Angelsu2019 Cup has a helpful introduction to brewing variables and experimentation. To summarize from that and other sources:nOver-extraction during brewing will cause bitter results. You can adjust that via: coarser grind, or shorter brewing time, or cooler brewing water [Angelsu2019 Cup says hotter but other sources say cooler], or less agitation (stirring), or adjust the coffee:water ratio. These recommendations assume you're close, but any variable can be off in either direction.nAll these adjustments can make the brew more sour, or too strong or weak, or otherwise unbalanced. There's a careful balance to achieve. They say temperature affects the sour notes more than the bitter notes.n(Heating the coffee afterwards should not make it more bitter, or not much, since it's no longer in contact with the grinds.)nExperiment! Start with adjusting the grind size. Finer grind makes for more bitter brew. Coarser grind makes for more sour brew. In between should be a happy trade-off.nBrewing is quite sensitive to grind size. If you don't get an even grind, you'll have some large particles and some small particles, which makes for some bitter notes and some sour notes together.nTherefore you'll need a good burr grinder. (I took recommendations from this Sweethome review.)nThis NY Times article adds:nnu2026 water extracts flavor from smaller coffee grounds faster than bigger ones. An inconsistent grind means sour taste from the small grains, and a bitter one from the big, all at the same time.nu2026 the colder the bean [when grinding], the more uniform particles it produced, and the more even the flavor.nu2026 put the beans in the freezer u2014 just keep them packed air tight to avoid staleness and moisture.nn(However, the Baratza grinder is not designed for grinding frozen beans.)nSome tips to wrap up:nnClean the grinder often (monthly?) and clean the brewing equipment daily so they don't accumulate rancid oils.nTry decaf. The decaffeination process reduces bitterness.nTry medium and light roasts.nStart with the AeroPress manufacturer's recipe, but don't stir 10 times. Put in the grinds, pour in the hot water up to #2, dab it with the stir stick a little to help it all get wet, wait 10 seconds, stir gently 2-3 times, then press.nUse a thermometer to get the water temperature right.nUse a scale to measure out the coffee.nStart with grind size #14 if you're using the Baratza Encore grinder. With 40 grind size steps, adjusting by u00b11 step makes a noticeable taste difference.nDon't bother with inverted (upside down) methods--those tend to produce more bitter coffee, and they risk a mess with hot water.nA paper filter produces 'smoother' tasting coffee than a bamboo filter does.nDon't bother pre-wetting the filter, at least not until you've experimented with more important variables. Pre-wetting will mainly let your water cool down.nnn",

The best results are when you get the butter fully emulsified in the coffee; think about blending the freshly brewed black coffee and butter together for the best effect. Otherwise you just get an unappealing layer of fat floating on top of the regular black coffee rather than the nice mixture.nnnI do not know if this will be a good answer for you but here it goes.nWhen I lived in France (small rural community), I used to put grass fed unsalted butter into my coffee all the time. I got the idea from reading articles about Tibetans putting yak butter into their black tea.nPersonally I enjoy it. It is an acquired taste because it is has a very rich and heavy flavor. Do not put milk or cream into your coffee as it will completely change your perspective on this great coffee idea. For myself, I prefer not to drink it just as it, safe the bottom of the barrel sort of speaking. I generally would dunk my rather dense bread (sometimes biscuits) into it at breakfast time and have enjoyed doing this as such for many years. nFor myself I only do this in the mornings.nnnI tried 'bulletproof coffee' recipe using a different brand of organic coffee and mixed in butter and coconut oil (instead of MTC oil). The coffee tasted creamy with a buttery/oily after taste. You can taste both the coconut and butter. If you're used to drinking strong coffee with cream this is not that much of a stretch. The effect of the caffeine in the coffee does last longer. nNow let's talk about the effectnBulletproof coffee or butter coffee was derived from the traditional Butter tea used in the Tibet and the Himalayas. In the region a higher caloric density Yak butter is used. nMCT oil, which is also present in sufficient amounts in coconut oil (coconut oil also has higher amounts to HDL cholesterol to negligible LDL cholesterol, which is good) is an addition in tweaking the traditional butter tea to achive a Cognitive Enhancement. LDL is essential to repair and maintain the Myelin sheath of neurons as such to good neural activity of the brain, MCT oil do not require energy for absorption, utilization, or storage. This means that MCT is generally considered a good biologically inert source of energy that the human body finds reasonably easy to metabolize. So in other words it provides a great energy boost with almost no fat storage. As such coconut oil constituting both, also metabolises into ketone bodies more efficiently than any other dietary substance, (Ketones may improve cognitive functioning) gives you a mental boot. MCT have been tested to improve cognitive functioning. MCTs also produce more ketones per unit of energy than normal dietary fats. (Note: higher Ketonema is achieved with low Carb intake, following through can give body a non starvation ketosis effect)nOther effects of butter coffee is that it helps your body regulate Insulin resistance blood sugar levels and the hormone Leptin (hormone responsible for body fat regulation, metabolism, breaking down fact for energy rather than storing).  Which in turn also has a cascading effect on your hunger signaling hormone Ghrelin, without the hormone being secreted you will feel full for a long time (granted you did not take carbohydrate of any sort with the coffee, this is important as carbohydrates will trigger the fats to be stored in your body rather than broken down for energy, and later on will trigger ghrelin after the crabs run out).nBut will it help you lose weight? Personally I felt, Uh, no!!!  Drinking coffee (in general) is liable to give you more energy, which may help motivate you to be more active, but only assuming you don't already drink a lot of caffiene.  Otherwise, all you're doing is offsetting the withdrawal symptoms. nnnOn top of other comments, one large community that benefits the effects of 'Bulletproof Coffee' are people on a Ketogenic diet (high fat, low carb). I'm currently on keto and have 3-5 BulletProof coffees a week; it definitely fills you up and the butter gives the coffee a different creaminess than with milk. If you use MCT oil, make sure to get 'flavorless', otherwise it can add an overbearing taste. nn",

Though it certainly depends on the preparation method ('method of extraction', e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is about 20% (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). nLess than ~15%-18% extraction is considered 'under-extracted' and can be sour. That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the fact that acids are extracted quickly. On the other hand, more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered 'over-extracted' and can be bitter, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.  nThese figures were generated by groups with lofty-sounding names like the Specialty Coffee Association of America, the Coffee Brewing Institute, and the Italian Espresso National Institute. Also known as 'solubles yield.' See also this article on espresso extraction.nStrength:nThe concentration of the extracted compounds in the water. Basically, how much coffee is in the water per unit (volume or mass).nAs noted in the question, there are also colloquial or vernacular uses of these terms (e.g., 'strength' as relative flavour profile; 'extraction' as the process of brewing, etc.) but the above seem to be the accepted tangible definitions of the terms.nn",

This refers to the repeating sequence of heating the coffee in a cezve, and then letting it cool down.nMy question is about both stages:nnhow do I know when it's heated enough to take it off the fire, andnhow much should it be cooled down?nnThe guides to brewing Turkish usually discuss that at the abstract level: heat + remove three times. I've been trying to do that, but my actions didn't seem to make sense. So right now I'm brewing it just once -- till the foam starts to rise, and enjoy it. But maybe I still can improve it?nnnDisclaimer: This will be a long answer. I expect that it wont be as good as I want at first. I may make corrections/additions afterwards. I am a native Turkish, drinking kgs of coffee each week and from a coffee addicted family for generations. Therefore, I count myself as a Turkish-coffee hobbyist.nI believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story.nThe chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire).nWhen you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)nThen, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.nBingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.nYou should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.nTalking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.nGet you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)nnIf you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest.nnnMeasure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.nnAfter you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.nnYou will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.nnAfter a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.nnStart stirring.n nNow, stop. Please check the foam. You have a quite nice foam already. Very very light color. No bubbles at all. It is not mature yet. If you want to be experienced in Turkish-style coffee brewing, look at that foam a lot. Follow its color and forms.nnStir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color.nCheck the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now.nWe'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans.nnnnStill, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full.nnnI would like to keep your attention to one point. At this point, you see the famous marbled foam of Turkish coffee for the first time. The reason is, you've mixed two different subsets of oils for the first time. Our final destination is to produce a coffee foam marbled with three colors.nnNow, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans.n(You really need to be quick, so I couldn't find time to focus and burnt the coffee a bit. Still, you can sense the boiling center. Sorry, for this picture and also I cannot provide a triple marbled foam for now as it burnt.)nnnNormally, there shouldn't be any grounds remain in cezve. Everything must be dissolved homogeneously in water.nnTraditionally, we prefer to serve Turkish coffee with half a sip of liquor of sharp tastes. Like mint, quince, sour cherry or bitter almond. This time, it was hazelnut liquor.nnA correctly prepared Turkish coffee is not a suspension of coffee grounds in water. Coffee grounds lay at the bottom and never fill in your mouth. The drinkable part stays on top.nnFinal words: This is it. I hope both theoretic and practical part helps people. Please leave comments so I can further advance this answer in time.nnnPut the pot in water for Turkish coffee. Add the coffee pot (1 teaspoon to 1 cup).nPot start heating. You can add sugar. Take the pot starting to boil water. Exactly actually it supposed to take before reaching the boiling point. :) Chocolate and coffee is good. But my favorite Nescafe gold.nn",

It seems to be vaguely salty + a lot of something else very destinctive that I can not describe. I would like to be able to detect and describe that flavor when I move to another bean and profile to be able to better know whether the profile/batch was a dud or I need to recup in a few days.nnnTo me, the more likely result of insufficient 'rest time' is a lack of flavor. It tastes like coffee, but without enough depth of flavor. In that case, I will simply let it rest for two days, then try the coffee again. Usually there is a noticeable improvement.nIn some cases, the flavor will not improve with more rest. That means that I did not roast the bean far enough.

When making a double shot , using a 30psi tamper, coffee did not flow from either spout, and when removing the portafilter it seemed to be under pressure, making a mess.nWhat am I doing wrong? And this is all new to me. Has been ok until today. nnnYou have an upscale espresso machine with a standard, non-pressurized portafilter. So as you know there normally isn't any pressure in the portafilter when you go to remove it after a shot.nBackflushing can only be done on machines like yours that have a 3-way valve. And it's basically just putting a blind (sealed) basket or rubber disc into the portafilter and pulling three short shot cycles. That is put the portafilter, with a blind basket into the group then let the pump run for about 8 seconds, then stop the pump for a few seconds. Then repeat two more times before removing the portafilter.nThis flushes out the brew path. Backflushing with water is safe but you shouldn't do a frequent chemical backflush on an E61 type machine. Most of the time this can be resolved by doing a backflush (sometimes you may need to do two or three backflushes) which will clean the brew path. When was the last time you did a backflush on the machine? You should be backflushing with plain water weekly. And with a food safe detergent every 200 shots.nWhen the portafilter does remain under pressure it means that the '3 way over-pressure valve' that normally relieves the group pressure is sticking. Or more precisely something in the expansion chamber is sticking or the internal E61 cam isn't moving completely smoothly. nThe easiest way to check for scale (mineral) buildup on an E61 machine like yours is to remove the gicleur chamber nut and mushroom at the top of the E61 assembly and visually inspect the removed parts and the group head internals which will now be visible.nnn",

They mention a specific temperature and you can see some apparatus.  Does anyone here know how accurate that segment of the show is, and whether there is a specific optimum process for making coffee which would ensure perfect coffee, even if it's not something you'd necessarily be able to reproduce at home?nnnAll coffee preparations can be improved with an application of science! Simply by monitoring and carefully controlling conditions such as water temperature, brew-time, grind etc., you can improve the taste of your coffee. No doubt with the array of instruments available to them in Breaking Bad they could have done a fine job of this!nAs for the aparatus, this Chemistry Stack Exchange answer goes into a lot of detail. It seems a vacuum pump is being used to boil the water at a lower temperature than otherwise. This setup might be a bit beyond what non-chemists are able to construct though!nIf you want to pretend you're in Breaking Bad while making your cup of coffee without a PhD in Chemistry, the closest you're going to get is with a Chemex flask:nnIt's basically pour-over drip coffee, albeit with proprietary, thicker filters that change the taste of the coffee (by removing more of the oils).nnnUsing science to brew the 'perfect coffee' is still fairly subjective...nEach scientist may be able to brew, to their own palate, a perfect cup. But palates being what they are, each cup and each method would be different.nThe alternative would be to run a series of trials with focus groups to see which coffees tested 'best'. And here danger lies...nArguably some of the worst coffee ever produced came from coffee manufactures and retailers using the focus group method. Because their focus was a mass market they tried to divine what was palatable to the largest audience and tried to produce 'a perfect coffee' when what they probably should have been doing was trying to find 'perfect coffees'.nMalcolm Gladwell gave an excellent Ted Talk entitled:nChoice, happiness and spaghetti sauce nI would really encourage you to watch the whole talk but here's an excerpt that makes the point pretty well:nAbout 15 minutes in...nnAnd the reason we thought that -- in other words, people in then  cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were lookingn  for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to ben  obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, throughn  the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.n  Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested inn  finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But thatn  changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the lastn  10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to then  understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want ton  know how necessarily -- just how cancer works, we want to know hown  your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer differentn  from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of humann  variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this samen  revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce. And for that,n  we owe him a great vote of thanks.nI'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that isn  -- oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principlesn  in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doingn  ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee.n  And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe. If In  were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- an  type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I askedn  you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffeen  would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed men  to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffeen  clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individualn  clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The differencen  between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffeen  that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.nnnnYes, there is absolutely an optimal temperature, not as much for brewing coffee, I believe, but for drinking it.  Perfect brewing would deliver coffee slightly above optimal drinking temperature.  Makers that can consistently deliver 200 degree coffee are considered the best machines.nHow hot is your coffeemakernn",

What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it correctly don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:nThe RoastnSome farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people and to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it just at the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can.nThe BrewnI've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I prefer to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. Drink it immediately with a clean palette. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.nThe TastenWhile debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process does. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are very picky cats.nBut, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes very close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).nConclusionnDon't raise your expectations too high, it's not really that much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.nIt tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day. nnnI had some Kopi Luwak, in Indonesia. I've read a number of reviews. It's been hard to find blind tastings by coffee experts. Basically, it doesn't seem like anything special. If anything, it kind of tastes bad.nNow, there may be more to the story. Indonesians I know have offered two explanations for why I was unimpressed. And these excuses were not mutually exclusive.nOne is a lack of certification -- that is, how do you know you were drinking real Kopi Luwak? Hah! Maybe somebody's faking you out!nThe other excuse is that, even when it's 'real', it might be factory farmed. This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.nOr so /that/ excuse goes.nI was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive. Maybe 30% more than anything comparable, when I was there last year. That margin might be narrowing. The cachet of Kopi Luwak being 'the world's rarest coffee' apparently become a selling point in Indonesia, but since the barriers to market entry are low (especially since verification is virtually non-existent), Indonesia is probably approaching an oversupply situation.nAt best, if you can identify Real Kopi Luwak, there might be something slightly more appealing about it compared to beans from the same estate that were not, erm, 'processed' by some wild Luwak 'cherry-picking' the best beans. More likely, though, no matter what you try, it will just taste how it tasted to me wherever I went: like something pooped out of some poor animal that was suffering from a serious caffeine addiction.nn",

The World Barista Championship specifies the proper construction in their beverage definitions (.PDF) in u00a72.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and at least 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the components, volume, and amount of foam define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in 'harmonious balance.'nThe WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such asnnvisual appearance, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;nserved with accoutrements, such as 'spoon, napkin and unflavoured water';nlogistical aspects of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.nnBeyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being 'wet' (referring to the foam, versus 'dry'), and 'traditional' (solid central circle of white foam, versus having latte art).nOther recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:nnFolgers suggests to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam.

Of course, that's additional equipment to keep and maintain, but doing the roasting yourself also probably represents some savings in supplies and wasted unused product.  You'd probably also be able to sell roasted beans so supplement the business.nHere's a good place to do some research - they supply great beans from ethical sources, and, of course, roasting equipment.

Where are you now in terms of your passion, knowledge and desire to provide coffee to customers, and where you want to be are good places to start.  Identify any potential barriers with the business, financially and operationally.  You should come up with a menu, and find a way to add value to your customers lives with the coffee that you serve and atmosphere that is provided in your shop.  I would suggest calling some roasters that you are fond of, they will provide you information on their products and best way to go about serving them and even starting your own shop with your given scenario.  This holds true, especially for the smaller roasters.  Continue to research and identify why you want to sell coffee, and maybe tackle your shop from that angle.

Citations are available through those links.nThere are certainly factors in caffeine absorption (e.g., how much of the total caffeine consumed is actually absorbed, how quickly it's absorbed, how quickly it is metabolized); some of those are addressed on the above links also.nIf you're asking about that Andrew chap specifically, see more info at the original article. Looks like it took him 5 days to drink the 128-oz monstrosity, but I hope it was enjoyable.  He would be in nearly exclusive position to answer these questions. If Andrew himself is reading this, perhaps he is willing to respond.nnnThis is just off the top of my headnSome of the issues you may see right of hand arenRestlessness, irritability, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, dizziness nausea, diarrhea, nervousness, shakiness. nEdit: here are some links as requested.nCaffeine is mainly used to boost awareness and caffeine can be found in a variety of drinks. Caffeine alone is very effective at perking a person up but if paired with sugar this can have a double 'energy effect since the sugar will also increase energy levels...but sugar will also cause a 'sugar crash' (that is another topic, regarding insulin/glucose levels in the blood.)nSo lets say you don't drink large doses of caffeine on a regular basis and you want to try and drink this famous 'cup of Joe' from Starbucks, what could go wrong? well it all depends on your caffeine tolerance. Just like a habitual user of nicotine or other stimulating drugs will be affected differently, a caffein user will tolerate different levels of a cup of joe depending on their weight, liver function to metabolize the caffeine and how much water you drink + kidney function. nCaffeine is a drug:nCaffeine is no more different than nicotine or cocaine, Why? because caffeine is considered a stimulant very much like nicotine and cocaine, it produces very similar effects thus some of the side effects may be similar as well. Also, caffeine is habit forming and a person can become dependent or addicted to it, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when coming off it.nCaffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.[10] It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but u2014 unlike many other psychoactive substances u2014 it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CaffeinenNicotine acts as both a stimulant and a sedative. Immediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a 'kick' caused in part by the drug's stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body, causing a sudden release of glucose as well as an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, causing smokers to be slightly hyperglycemic. In addition, nicotine indirectly causes a release of dopamine in the brain regions that control pleasure and motivation. This reaction is similar to that seen with other abused drugsu2014such as cocaine and heroinu2014and is thought to underlie the pleasurable sensations many smokers experience. In contrast, nicotine can also exert a sedative effect, depending on the level of the smoker's nervous system arousal and the dose of nicotine taken.nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nicotinennnI can only add 2 links at a timenCocaine is a stimulant drug as it directly affects the central nervous system. Cocaine was used in the past as a local anaesthetic in many countries. Cocaine is a white powder obtained from the leaves of the coca plant which grows in many areas of South America. It is a powerful stimulant, which has similar effects to amphetamines.nhttp://www.atour.com/health/docs/20000617a.htmlnhttps://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htmnSymptoms of caffeine over use in adults may include:nBreathing troublenChanges in alertnessnConfusionnConvulsionsnDiarrheanDizzinessnFevernHallucinationsnIncreased thirstnIncreased urinationnIrregular heartbeatnMuscle twitchingnRapid heartbeatnSleeping troublenVomitingnthese are not all the symptoms as stated in the article, Also if we take in consideration that caffeine is a vasoconstrictor (makes your veins and arteries squeeze together) this increases pressure in the circulatory system causing your blood pressure to increase and heart rate to go up.nWe can sit here and go on an on with articles or references, case in point, if you do not suffer from any medical conditions and are considered to be a healthy individual you can try and drink this famous cup of coffee but it would probably be best if you spaced it out and don't just down the whole cup right there on the spot. The most immediate effects you will most likely encounter is the increased heart rate and the nervousness then possible GI upset. after that you are putting your self at risk if you keep going,nThe caffeine amounts of the espresso-based drinks show that a Tall Latte (and Cappuccino) has just a single shot of coffee. For a 12 oz cup size u2013 this is quite weak and has considerably less caffeine than a brewed coffee of the same sizenaccording to Mayo Clinic:nUp to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two 'energy shot' drinks. Although caffeine use may be safe for adults, it's not a good idea for children.nn",

I use mostly the aeropress and the Chemex.nMy grinder is a Hario manual grinder. I want to get an electric one.nHow much should I spend, minimum, on a electric grinder so I can get a good grind for my brewing methods?nnnDepends on if you want to be able to grind true espresso grinds.  My daily grinder I received as a wedding present and it suits me just fine, a Cuisinart for about $40 dollars.  If I want to grind for espresso, this is completely incapable of doing so, so I ended up getting a $180 dollar unit that is capable of timed grinding and grinding to espresso level grind.  This unit is a Breville with a cone burr, which I honestly really like because it doesn't have the static of the Cuisinart.nThis is very much a personal choice type of question.  If you have $10000 burning a hole in your pocket, I'm sure you could find a grinder to match, or if you are worried about keeping the lights on, you could probably find one to suit your needs as well.nHere are a few recommendations..nLow End:nCuisinart DBM-8 -- Does good coarse grind, to a reasonably fine grind.  Drip brewers and pour over are right in the middle of its standard grind range.  Biggest con is it is a flat disc grinder and generates quite a bit of static so be aware that it will make a bit of a mess.  Cannot grind espresso.nMid Range (150-250) -- The Baratza Encore is really popular and a pretty good price.  It has conical burrs and gearing specifically intended to reduce static and heat.  I personally use a Breville Dose Control Pro which is about the least expensive grinder I could find with the portafilter holder and timed grinding.  Thus far I've been happy with it, low static, very very fine grind level for espresso if needed, but I am seeing some reviews about how the internal components tend to fail after extended use.  Someone may be able to comment on the feasibility of the Encore for espresso grind better than I.  Breville can grind espresso, someone please comment on Encore / Virtuoso espresso grind capability!nHigh Range --  The sky is the limit here.  You could go with a higher end Baratza going all the way to the 1000 dollar range and probably higher, if you've got that $10,000 dollars burning a hole in your pocket you could go big with a 60 lb EK43 (and then send me a big tip!).. just kidding.  The EK43 runs about 2500 and is a shop grinder, although it is now a barista favorite for competition.  When you start getting into the super high end machines, personally my favorite is Mahlkonig but really.. there's no reason for this caliber of grinder at home.  nAgain, how much to spend is a tricky question.  I would say a minimum of $40 and a max of however much you want to spend.  If you have the money, and want a solid reliable workhorse, I would probably go with either the Baratza Encore or Baratza Virtuoso.  Baratza is one of the higher quality, and popular home grinders that don't completely break the bank.nnnTo begin, the Sweethome review The Best Coffee Grinder is quite helpful for background and their experimental evaluation of grinders, although of course they only tested a modest number of the available grinders.nSweethome says what a grinder needs to make tasty coffee is to produce consistently- and uniformly-sized coffee grounds because coffee extraction is sensitive to grind size. Uneven grounds cause uneven extraction which produces overly bitter and sour tastes. Other sources agree.nMy (limited) experiments back this up: The Baratza Encore grinder has 40 grind size steps, step #20 (depending on the type of beans) is my favorite for a drip coffee maker. Adjusting the setting u00b11 makes the coffee noticeably sour or bitter, as verified by blind tasting. So we can expect uneven grounds to make coffee that has more bitter and sour notes.nSweethome and other sources explain how blade grinders produce uneven grounds including fine particles. Burr grinders produce more even grounds. Particle size distribution is not easy to measure, esp. when static electricity makes particles stick together. (If you find evidence that a particular blade grinder can produce about as even results as a good burr grinder, please point it out!)nNote: Sweethome shows that the Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder has blades around a plastic burr. And indeed, they measured the DBM-8 distribution of particle sizes to be about as broad as whatever blade grinder they used for comparison.nNote: Nitpicking Sweethome's review, their charts showing the distribution of ground particle sizes would be more readable and more revealing if drawn as stack charts, one stack for each grinder to compare against the other stacks. The vertical label 'Particle weight (in grams)' really means 'Amount of particles (in grams)' in the given particle size range. The charts would also be more readable showing grind sizes from small to large rather than backwards. You can zoom the web page and hover your mouse over the right-side labels to make its graph line stand out.nCaveats: Are 5 measurement buckets enough to go on? Also, we're led to assume the grinder is set so that its particle-size distribution is centered in the middle of a measurement bucket. If set to center on the border between two measurement buckets, then the chart would look 1 bucket wider (out of 5) for the same actual distribution width. The main comparison chart is for a coarse grind size. Is that representative for medium and fine grind sizes?nWith the Baratza Encore, 1 size step from favorite makes a tasteable difference. Baratza documents that the grinder has 40 steps from 250 to 1200 microns. Are those steps linearly spaced? Log spaced? Linear spacing would be (1200 - 250 microns) / 39 intervals = 24.4 microns/interval = 0.024mm/interval, and my favorite grind size #20 would be 0.725mm That's in the < 0.76 mm bucket at the end of Sweethome's chart, which is fishy. Maybe the steps are not linear.nEither way, the distribution width is much larger than the step size. Since adjusting by 1 step matters, it suggests that we really want a more uniform particle size than current grinders achieve.nThe AeroPress FAQ gives another answer to why it's important to use a good quality grinder:nnA good grinder will grind coffee into particles of uniform size. Very fine particles block the flow of water and make it difficult to press. The same blocking occurs if your grinder is dull and produces particles of varying size because the fine particles block the spaces between the larger particles.nn(The AeroPress seems to be less sensitive to grind size than drip coffee machines. Are espresso makers more sensitive to grind size than drip machines?)nWhile grind size is the main evaluation factor, there are secondary considerations like the ability to grind finely enough for your espresso machine, ease of use, how long it takes, and how loud it is.nSweethome's answer to your price questionnnHigh end: $2,700 Mahlku00f6nig EK43 commercial-grade burr grinder.nRecommended: $230 Baratza Virtuoso burr grinder.nSecond best: $130 Baratza Encore burr grinder.nBudget pick: $92 Capresso Infinity burr grinder.nLow cost fallback: $33 Hario Mini Mill Slim hand grinder.nnBut: These sources don't really answer the question how much to spend for your tastes? How uniform does your grind size need to be?nIf you're not a coffee taste enthusiast, or if you add enough sugar to mask bitter and sour tastes, then you might be happy with an inexpensive blade grinder. Try doing a blind taste test comparison of bitterness and sourness for a blade grinder vs. a (hand or electric) burr grinder -- after tuning their grind-size settings.nFor coffee taste enthusiasts, it's pretty likely that you'll want the most consistent- and uniformly-sized grounds you're willing to pay for. Of course, results that measure almost as uniform might taste the same. Again, try a blind taste test.nn",

Does it relate to the caffeine amount?nThe coffee package is from Germany, and from what I've seen, all coffee sorts have this rating, so it's a kind of standard.nnnComing from Germany myself I have seen this rating only on a single brand of coffee. There is no standard for this (even though us Germans seem to like standardizations), but basically strength of the coffee is about the inherent bitterness and caffeine content you get out of it.nThe stonger a coffee the more caffeine and also the more bitterness you will usually get.nnnIt's marketing jargon. In this case, it likely refers to the darkness of the roast, as there is often confusion about difference between darkness of the roast and the strength of a cup of coffee.nIn truth, coffee has no 'strength' until it is brewed. And then, strength is determined by how many solubles you have dissolved into the water. If you want stronger coffee, use more grounds per measure of water. Over-extracting the coffee will make it stronger, but it will also make it more bitter and less pleasant at the same time. (If you're interested, here is a more detailed explanation of this).nnnWhen people talk about strength they often confuse different things like the flavor intensity, caffeine concentration, roast grade, how full bodied a coffee tastes or how much bitterness it contains.nIf someone orders a coffee at a corner bakery and asks for a 'strong coffee' they probably mean a high ground coffee to water ratio and a lot of dissolved caffeine. If someone complains in the same bakery about coffee that is too strong they probably mean that it is too bitter.nIf a coffee professional is talking about coffee strength however, they are most likely referring to the total amount of dissolved solids (or TDS) which is measured with a refractometer. An espresso ranges somewhere in between 7% and 15% while a filter coffee is somewhere around 1,5%. That means an espresso is 93%-85% water and a filter 98,5%. The rest is what has been extracted from the coffee. Keep in mind that this is not to be confused with extraction. Higher extraction (bitter coffee) doesn't make a strong, but actually a 'weak' coffee. Because you are running more water through the coffee the TDS will start to decrease at the point where the next ml of water is extracting less of the solids than the ml before. That means that in terms of flavor 'strong' means often the opposite of what people would actually associate with a strong coffee. Holding the dosage constant, a strong espresso (too little water, thus something like a ristretto) would taste kind of sour, salty and unbalanced. A weak espresso (too much water) would taste bitter.nThe point is, strength refers at first not to flavor but to the TDS which is determined by your coffee preparation and not by the roasting. The same coffee roasted darker is not stronger, it just received more heat.nNow, your package of coffee probably refers with it's 'three out of five strength' to the roast grade (probably a medium to dark roast) which is just misleading marketing in my opinion.nSome additional reading:nAnalyzing espresso recipe strengthnand Espresso Recipes: Understanding YieldnnnThe Starbucks-owned brand 'Seattle's Best Coffee' uses numbers on its bagged supermarket coffees, too. I equate it to the stars you can use to order Asian takeout with more or less spiciness. There's no set scale I've ever found, but it's a general way to tell the consumer where on the spectrum each product (roughly) lies.nn",

Think of it as a morning tinkle for the CWTF15-APS to git rid of the rank overnight water fouling your morning joe. nUse an extra filter. Substandard inputs are signiflatulanceficantly improved by an additional filter.nScrape the the cheeto and donut leavin's off of the lip of your coffee cup once in a while.  The 'seasoned' coffee cup is a myth as proven in a blind taste test where we forced coworkers to drink coffee from a randomly selected sampling of well seasoned and clean coffee mugs.  There was a little bit of a flatulence effect with seasoned mugs in that a subset of coworkers 'liked their own brand' in testing, but the overwhelming data suggest that dirty mugs are just gross. nnnnPut a tiny pinch of kosher salt in with the grinds. It won't make the coffee salty, but it will help you squeeze every bit of flavor those pre-packaged grinds still have to give. Works best with darker roasts, look for a slight improvement, not a miracle :)nAlso, Go with an extra tablespoon or two of coffee. As Chris In AK mentions - it's easy to add water to strong coffee to weaken it a bit, but you can't do much with weak coffee if you like it stronger. Though, if you do this, there should be some means of obtaining clean hot water close to where people get their fill. nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I am looking for a coffee type that is naturally sweet, like sugar snap peas. So there is no need to add sugar, when I drink it.nnnThis question is probably best answered in two directions:nnIf you feel the need to add sugar to your coffee, it may simply be that the coffee that you are drinking is not very good. Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.nIf you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:nnThere are a couple of coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour. For example, I have a some 'Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso' here, which is described by the producer by 'Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness'. When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. But don't expect too much. Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted Arabica Bourbon coffee beans should have a 'fine sweetness'. Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - 'particularly sweet' means in comparison to other beans!nIn case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. nnnnnThere are several coffee varieties that have a 'sweeter' taster. nVarieties that have a delicate taste like Rhume Sudan, Geisha, Villa Sarchi, Montecristo, Bourbon, Maragogype will produce a sweeter cup when you apply a softer extraction (like a V60), and you use a light roast and natural or whiney processing. nHowever, as stated on another answer, coffee has very low calories and contains very few sugars, beside trace leftovers from the fruit during processing.  So don't expect a strong sweet taster, but rather a very subtle reminder of sweetness. nnnTry Hawaiian Coffee or formerly known as Kona Coffee, it has sweet caramel taste to it.  It's expense at $7- $55 dollars, but make sure it's 100% pure Kona coffee or else it won't taste the same.  nI recommend it, I buy it form the farmers Market from Dekalb County.nnnPlants growing at lower temperatures have a better chance to accumulate sugar in the cherry. As a rule of thumb, temperature lowers as elevation increases but at higher altitudes other flavour qualities are lost. Your best bet is finding places where altitude is not too high but climate conditions provide cooler climates. In Colombia, coffees from Nariu00f1o; Filandia, Risaralda or Oiba, Santander tend to be very sweet.nhttp://colombiancoffeehub.com/colcoffeehub/lecture-how-are-sugars-in-coffee-p_1467410nnnA few considerations when choosing a 'sweet' coffee..nnI saw posted that lower elevation equals more sugar.  Lower elevation also typically signifies higher caffeine which is very bitter.nLook for light roasts with mild acidity.  Why light roasts?  Coffee beans coloration comes from Maillard reactions, a key component of which is sugar caramelization. While in your mind, caramel is sweet, raw sugar (sucrose for instance) is significantly more sweet than caramelized sugar.nWhy low acidity?  While acidity isn't bad in a coffee, I feel like if you are trying to optimize sweetness, acidity detracts from perceived sweetness. nnIt's really difficult to say what origin is most sweet, but it may be a better approach to say what origins have flavor components that might help add to a perceived sweetness.  For me, I like a good Guatemalan or Ethiopian for a clean, brisk sweet cup of coffee.nOne other note.. Espresso roasts 'should' be optimized to minimize acidity and bitterness while maintaining as much sweetness as possible.  You may find some espresso beans that will fit the bill for sweetness, but I still think you can find more sweet coffees at lower roast levels.nnnIt depends on what kind of 'sweetness' you're looking for. I don't think there are any naturally flavored coffees that will give you a white sugar kinda sweet, at least nothing that I have come across yet.  nBut I think that a lot of the Ethiopian coffees that are naturally processed give a really sweet taste. More like berries(blueberries and strawberries.)nnnCoffee by nature is a simi sweet. But once the gas escapes from the bean it turns bitter. So come up to my place. We will drive out to the plantation & have a few cups of natural sweet coffee. nn",

They are only on the bottom of the pot as far as I can tell, not the sides. They look sort of like black mold, but I gave the pot a gentle scrub with warm water and a mild soap and they didn't budge.nI don't normally use soap on my pot. Generally I make a cup of coffee, rinse all components, and allow them to air dry. Sometimes when I'm pressed for time, the just-used pot sits in the sink for a few hours without getting disassembled or rinsed. I have a hunch that that moisture may be contributing here. I use filtered water, so I don't think they are mineral deposits (unlike in this case). The pot is pretty new. It's been used 1-3 times per day for about three weeks.nSo what are these spots? If they aren't affecting the flavor of the result, do I need to worry about them? If so, how can they be removed?nnnShort story: They are probably aluminum oxide, but almost certainly some kind of metal oxide. You don't need to take any action unless they're affecting the taste of your coffee, and it shouldn't be. You probably can't (or shouldn't) really permanently remove them even if you wanted to.nLonger story...nThis is a classic Bialetti model, and a classic Bialetti symptom. The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic failure of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.nThe vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and dried thoroughly in The Right Way. The 'care' page for Bialetti (follow that link, then click on the 'Care Use' tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to dry thoroughly and most tellingly 'Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation.' Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. nStandard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and facilitates further oxidation).nI have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and cleanable) as the metaphorical 'whistle'.nFor completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; this answer to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup ('scale') from using 'hard' water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses.nn",

Although I want to reduce the caffeine, I don't want to compromise on the taste. The decaf options that I have tried so far were disappointing, such that I was hoping somebody else had any specific brand recommendations?nnnI roast my own, but my green bean supplier also supplies decaffeinated unroasted beans.  I always have a pound on hand, but have never had occasion to roast and use them.nnnI find that Kenco Freeze Dried Decaf is very tasty - much better than Nestcafe. However I will say I have not yet found a good decaf filter/espresso coffee.nnnYears ago, the best decaf coffee I had was from a home roaster. If you are lucky, you can find one near you!nI do NOT drink coffee after 4:00 PM because the caffeine keeps me awake. But sometimes I crave a cup of coffee after dinner. Decaf coffee roasts differently than non-decaf, and most decafs just taste 'off'. nA friend of mine starting drinking decaf a few years ago. I started buying high quality decaffeinated green coffee from Sweet Maria's to roast some for him (and myself).nIt took a few tries for me to learn how to roast it properly - slower is better (easy to over-roast decafs). Now I always have my own roasted decaf coffee available when the rare urge for late night coffee hits me.nnnWhen we werekeeping our caffeine consumption low, we used to brew a 50:50 mix of normal and decaf.  Both were at the good end of what the supermarket sells ground, and were a nominally similar roast.  The overall efect was like slightly less good normal.nYou could probably progress to something like 25% normal in decaf, especially if the normal was a slightly richer flavour than the decaf.nYou could of course step all of this up a level by buying beans to grind yourself or buying small quantities of freshly-ground.nWe used Cafe Direct decaf for this.  I've since given up on that idea and have my last coffee of the day just after lunch, so this was a few years ago.nnnThe Whole Foods (Allegro) decaf blends are not bad. If I had to drink decaf I would still want some fresh beans and my own grind. However, the best quick and easy instant I have found (decaf or regular) is Mount Hagen.nnnI'm based in Portland, so luckily there's no shortage of options in the coffee arena. Heart has an amazing decaf that I've had the pleasure of cupping with 9 other coffees (non-decaf) and I rated it in my top 3 for overall taste, and other folks there did as well.nIt uses a natural decaffeination process involving little more than sugar cane, allowing much more of the flavor to remain. Here's an article explaining this process a bit - it's likely the only type of decaf I'll have from now on (EA process decafs):nnColombia is well known for growing coffee, but also sugar cane. The grow lots and lots of it. So they use Ethyl Acetate (EA) from the sugar cane, and dissolve it into water for the caffeine extraction. Another claim they make is that EA decaffeination removes irritant substances that benefits people with sensitive stomachs.nnnnI would always stick with a CO2 extracted coffee. Swiss water method will dilute the flavor and chemical decaffeinating is well....chemical-ish.  I asked for you as I was reading this at a coffee shop. I don't normally drink decaf but as I get older the need to slow my caffeine down is real (and sucks)nnnI have two brand recommendations for you. If you want a great decaf coffee, look no further than Mayorga. Beyond being organic, they use the water based method of caffeine extraction to avoid the use of nasty chemicals. nAnother decaf coffee option that is very unique is Javazen Relax(Javazen is my company).  It is organic coffee blended with herbal teas, this case rooibos. Beyond the decaf blend, Javazen has other coffee+tea blends which may be helpful for your transition away from caffeine. nnnOne of my favorites is Mystic Monk Coffee.  I personally order their regular caffeinated coffee, but I have tried their decaf and they are just as good.nThey also make some flavor coffee that is decaf as well as regular, and they release some seasonal flavors every 3 months.nThere is also a half-decaf they offer of their regular roast, which you might be interested in as well.  nOne other thought that I just had, is to possibly go with a flavored coffee.  Something that might be similar to a coffee flavor, and look for that in Decaf.  I have a local place near me that has about 200 different flavors and they can make it in regular or decaf.  Unfortunately, they are local only and don't have a website or do any shipping of orders at all.  OrangeCat is the name of the place, if you want to keep an eye out for them.nSome 'flavors' that might be close to what you are looking for (thinking of what I have had that may be similar to a coffee flavor, but everyone has a different taste and palette)....  nnmocha ntoffee ntoffeenut ncaramel ncreme brulee ntoasted graham crackers & choclatendark chocolatennsome other flavors that might taste similar...nnfrench valillanrumnalmond / amarettonhazelnutnnFresh Roasted Coffees (Mystic Monk Coffee) nLittle Monk Blend (Mystic Monk Coffee)nn",

Through these good fit, the coffee filter can not collapse duringn  the brewing process.nnAdditional fact: The coffee filter was not invented by Melitta the company, but by Melitta Bentz.nnSorry for that bad translation. My English is really not the best. Please improve me!nnnHere is what I found:nnTrying to tear out a proper filter is difficult. Filters do resist to boiling-water temperature.nTrying to tear out a proper filter along the seam is quite easy.nnSo, by folding the filter on the seam, it seems we kind of hide the seam from direct contact with hot water. The seam glue is not weak these days, but this way there is no risk of tearing (e.g. if there is a defect in the seam), and the surface area inside the filter is also more uniform---the filter stands well in place.nThere is a seam in the first place, because it is easy to manufacture fold-able filters this way (I am looking for a citation here).nnnGood Morning coffee drinkers !nI am now getting on for 70 years old  and I remember when my mother in Norfolk UK bought her first ground coffee filter machine. She used 'Melitta' filters and told me to always fold the two seams. I have never forgotten this advice and along with a lot of knowledge passed on over the years I continue to do this. I settled in France around 30 years ago and have never noticed any one folding the edges over here  -  even my french wife has never accepted that it is necessary. However, she has, from time to time had the filter collapse when she has been responsible for preparing the coffee.....nSO  -  the reasons for doing this are to me, at any rate fairly clear and I agree with the reasoning of both the Melitta company & Eric Platon.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "My new job has me buying my own coffee for the first time in my professional career.  I'm amazed at the amount of coffee I consume.  I brew at my desk using an aeropress.  Has anyone tried to use the grounds more than once?  Any tips as I try it out?nnnIn general, I argue that you shouldn't be able to re-use the grounds. That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. nThat said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests you might want to change other parameters of your brewing. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see this Q/A for what I mean by extraction in this case.nYou could try this experimentally also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)nAs a practical note, you might also consider simply to brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups.nnnWith a manual espresso machine, I have used the same grounds for two pulls. They are ok in a pinch if I want that volume but don't want to redo the grind, tamp etc.  But honestly it is not as good as the first time through. The only thing I can suggest is that when I do them one after the other, it is ok. If I wait for the grounds to cool it is not really drinkable. nnnI think this question has been satisfactorily answered for hot brewing, like in an Aeropress. I think it's worth adding that double-brewing is worth trying if you cold brew.nI have recently tried double-brewing with my Filtron cold brewer, and found the results to be quite good. A single pound of coffee yields 2 liters of extract with this method, which I dilute to roughly 2.5 gallons of coffee (320 ounces, in other words 20x16oz cups). nCold brewing doesn't abide by the same rules as hot brewing because it happens at a low temperature and doesn't extract any of the bitterness typical of over-brewing at a high temp. nnnI used to do this for a co-worker and me. We'd use three AeroPress spoonfuls of coffee (which is a lot) to make two cups. I think the theory was that the saturation of that much coffee grounds in the small amount of water that took up what little room was left in the AeroPress chamber, was not efficient at all. So we'd brew the same grounds twice. This made for more bitter coffee, because the coffee was over extracted, and it pulled the tannins into solution.nWe opted for simply letting the coffee brew longer and increasing pressure during the press to force extract more out of the grounds. This yielded a much stronger concentrate that we'd then dilute to normal coffee/water proportions. This created a delicious and full cup of coffee every time.  nI think for your case, you'd be brewing hours apart with the same grounds to save money, and I think you totally could. The issue I see is that most caffeine in coffee is extracted within seconds of brew time, so your second brew with those grounds may not yield a nicely drugged cup of joe. So not only will the taste be bitter, but it may also put you to sleep.nnnI've tried using coffee grounds twice and obviously there is a quality and potency difference, if you just really want to stretch your coffee more than you can use less coffee per cup or if you are like me and just like the feeling of having a warm cup then reuse the coffee grounds twice but the second time around it better to brew it twice as long.nnnI do this with a French press, usually with a medium roast. My best results have come from exaggerating the quantity of beans the first time (many times at an increased extraction temperature), then extracting a second time with a larger water:coffee ratio. I haven't taken measurements, but it don't feel a caffeine rush from the second extraction.nnnThis morning I used my coffee grounds twice. I forgot to buy more coffee, so I placed my French press with the used grounds in the refrigerator over night. In the morning I brought the French press out with the used grounds. I had about one tablespoon of fresh coffee grounds left in my bag of coffee. I added that to the used grounds. It came out pretty good. No doubt the small amount of fresh grounds helped. nIn a pinch, it beats going without coffee in the morning.nnnI tend to use coffee batches twice, as I use the first batch, I then place a little on top, and let it brew.  Though, do realize, I make my first batch extremely strong.  Tastes delicious that way. nI'm an amateur to my compatriots, but they never really complained about it to me.  (Navy) nn",

            "long_summary__c": "What would happen if one were to substitute milk in place of water for the following brewing methods:nnPercolating/Moka pot; nPour over; nAeropress; nFrench PressnnWould it extract anything from the coffee grounds? Would it create something passable?nnnAttempt 1nFor the first attempt, I brewed it exactly like I brew my normal (water-based) coffee. I used a French Press with a light/medium roast, heating the milk in Pyrex in a microwave. The milk heated unevenly, curdling in places. Luckily, the curdled bits stuck to the Pyrex and I was able to make a passable cup. The thickness of the milk meant that it didn't want to pass through the mesh when pouring.nThe predominant flavor was that of the milk. I could barely tell it was coffee, though it definitely absorbed some flavor. The texture was about what you'd expect--very smooth and rich. It was the kind of drink that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.nAttempt 2nFrom my first attempt, I learned that milk is able to absorb and mask coffee's flavor incredibly well (after all, it's what people use to tone down overly strong coffee). This time, I heated the milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently (a rather long and annoying process for a single cup of coffee). I probably could have gotten it a bit hotter, but it worked well enough. I nearly doubled the amount of grounds and brew time.nThis time, it came out with a distinct coffee smell, and about the same texture. Again, the initial flavor was that of the milk, but it had a smooth, subtle, and quite pleasant coffee aftertaste. I never got that bad taste you sometimes get a while after a normal cup of coffee--instead, the residual flavor was like you had just taken a sip.nConclusionsnI wouldn't want milk-brewed coffee for my morning cup. It feels more like a drinkable dessert.nIf anyone else wants to try this, I recommend using some stronger/darker coffee. I didn't have any dark roast on hand, or I would have tried it. Give it time to brew--more than you would with water. Be patient when heating the milk, or you'll end up curdling it and ruining the whole thing.nThis could probably work as a dessert drink if brewed with some spices in addition to the coffee. If nothing else, I'd say it looks pretty cool as you can see in the attached image.nUPDATEnI tried this again today with espresso coffee (Cafe Bustelo), and it turned out great. The end result was like a latte but more... dull, or smooth. I don't know how exactly to compare it. Espresso grind is definitely the right choice when brewing with milk--it's the only thing strong enough and with the right flavor profile to stand out in the milk and complement the milk's flavor.nBe warned, though, that the fine grind of espresso coffee means you will need to use a paper filter at some point along the way. Sticking a paper filter in a French Press doesn't work because of how resistant the milk is to going through the filter. It seems to jet around the sides, allowing the espresso to slip through.nnnnBasically don't try to replace water with milk in a Moka Pot.  You'll clog the brewer up with curdled milk, and either you will spend a ton of time cleaning it, or you will just throw it away.  nI think there are going to be a few problems with replacing water with milk.  nnSince you are extracting with a liquid that already has some dissolved solids, I would guess it will not extract as well as water.  This correlates well with RogueCSDev's results in that you need a dark roast which will tend to extract more easily than a light roast.nYou will have an issue with overheating the milk and causing curdling.  Steamed milk in espresso based drinks is usually heated to 150-160 degrees.  To heat it beyond 170 degrees is going to create burnt flavors in the milk.  Since optimal brewing temperature for coffee extraction is ~35 degrees above the burn point for milk, I don't see a way to get around this without using a cold brew type of method trading extraction time for heat.nnI just saw a mention of brewing espresso with milk..  For readers in the future DO NOT put milk in an espresso machine (This isn't what the writer was intending, but it is easy to misread)..  Putting milk into a boiler on an espresso machine is a sure fire way to add some weight to your trashcan, or cause significant damage.  This is the entire reason why you purge your steam wand, to prevent milk from being pulled into the boiler.  Long story short, it will cause bacterial growth inside the espresso machine inside the small components which will require a complete break-down and cleaning, something that on a small machine would cost more than replacing the machine, and on a large machine will cause long downtime and very high repair costs.nnnI think it would be harder to extract everything that you would like from the coffee with milk for a few reasons. nnheat effects the extraction process. For most methods you are aiming for a temperature of around 200u00b0F for a good extraction. The problem with milk is that it will curdle at 180u00b0F. This doesn't allow you to get everything out of the coffee that you might like to.nMilk has fat in it which pulls out the hydrophobic compounds of the coffee(the oils) a lot more quickly than water does. The coffee oils contain a lot of the bitter notes, so it can be easy to over extract the coffee. nnI just tried cold brewing with milk and I found it pretty delicious. It was definitely more milk flavored than coffee flavored, think chocolate milk but instead coffee milk(duh :p). I only brewed it for 3 hours, probably could have brewed it for four and still been fine.  nn",

In the US, there seems to be the issue that a 'Macchiato' at Starbucks is something different from an actual Macchiato. nFrom Wikipedia, this is what I consider a Macchiato:nnCaffu00e8 macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed.n  [...] The caffu00e8 macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients.nnI have run into this a few times, even at coffee shops that seem to make a big deal about their coffee knowledge etc. I order a Macchiato, and receive a huge cup with mostly milk and some espresso. nI would like to be clear as to what I want when I order, but I also want to avoid sounding like a jerk if I specify exactly what I want, or sounding dumb if I describe the drink rather than ordering by its name. What is a good way of achieving this?nnnThe problem with ordering a 'Macchiato' is that it's only half of the name of a traditional coffee drink.n'Macchiato' means 'stained' or 'flecked' and not more.nIn Italy, you have either nnLatte macchiato: *Milk 'stained' with coffee (more precisely caffu00e8 or espresso) ornEspresso macchiato: Espresso (or caffu00e8) 'stained' with a spoonful of milk foam.nnIf you order a 'Macciato' without qualifier, you will either get what the chain defines as such (for Starbucks, a lot of milk and foam with one or multiple shots of espresso) or what your barista thinks of first - and that would often be a (latte) macchiato, i.e. a glass of milk and foam with an espresso layer inbetween. nSo my recommendation is:nIf you want a serving of espresso with a bit of milk, order an espresso macchiato. I just double-checked with the Starbucks US website and yes, they do have espresso macchiato on the menu. Any decent barista from the (self proclaimed) high-end places you mention should be familiar with these terms anyway. The fine difference between 'coffee' and 'caffu00e8' (see below) might be 'lost in translation' and they will be using an espresso machine in 99% of all cases anyway.nnComment re. your Wikipedia link:nPlease note the spelling: caffu00e8 is not the same as American coffee! The former is what you get when you use a stovetop moka pot, which creates a brew similar (but not identical) to espresso. Both are served in rather small serving units and for coffee drinks used somewhat interchangeably.

            "long_summary__c": "The Brikka, like many stovetop espresso makers, has a lot of parameters that affect how the espresso turns out.nWhat are the best parameters for using the Brikka correctly? Which of these are more vital to getting the crema to stick around once you pour the espresso into the cup?nMy current list is:nnGround coffee particle size (compared to espresso machine fine or coarser)nAmount of water filled in the bottom partnAmount of coffee you put in the basket and compression - this one is supposed to be easy, fill it up without a hump and without pressing it downnThe fire size and strength under the Brikka - I use the smallest flame base, but using the smallish 2-cup Brikka it is a bit bigger than the base when on maximal burn.nWhen exactly to turn off the fire under the BrikkanWhen exactly to pour the coffee (it says right after the coffee comes out, but there is coffee still coming out of the nozzle if I pour it too soon).nnnnI think you gave a good overview of everything. Here's a few comments on your list that I find is most important from my own personal experience, and from this Bialetti guide.nn'Moka' grind is imperative. Most guidelines that I have seen recommend somewhere coarser than espresso and finer than drip (e.g., illy, Blue Bottle, and a bunch of blogs when searching 'best grind for moka' or so). Finer and you might overextract and result in a bitter brew; too-coarse and the machine won't extract properly or develop any pressure in the bottom chamber.nThe amount of water is almost completely determined by the size of the moka pot. Fill nearly (but not quite) up to the over-pressure relief valve; looks a bit like a button. The moka pot is made to brew exactly that amount of coffee; no more, no less.n(exactly as you said). Amount of coffee: filled to the top of the funnel, but not tamped.nHeat: for a gas-flame-burner, as with any pot, matched to pot size is best. The flame being completely under and within the base is best. It should heat quickly, but the flame should not creep around the sides; you want the bottom to be heated only, not the sides and certainly not the top vessel! This is the reason for the shape of this and a cezve having a wide bottom.nTurn off as soon as the machine starts coughing or sputtering. At this point the water level is below the bottom of the funnel straw, and no more (desirable) extraction will occur.nServe as soon as safe! Soon after the fire is off, it should stop sputtering. Best to pour and serve immediately thereafter. nnand...nnOne thing you didn't mention: it's best to fill the bottom chamber (carefully!) with already-boiling water (as in Blue Bottle guide, linked above.) This ensures that the water boils quickly and evenly, and minimizes the amount of (undesirable) 'steaming' and heat prior to brewing to which the grounds will be subjected.nnAs for the crema, I've never been able to create crema with anything other than a proper espresso machine, as noted in this moka question I had linked.nnnI understand that the crema created by the Brikka is an approximated crema using the gasket's small opening. Sure, purists may not consider this tan, smooth film of microbubbles as authentic crema (akin to espresso makers), but it does do a good job creating it for a close mouthfeel. nI use my Brikka every day, and it creates the 'Brikkrema' (as I'd like to call it) just fine [see the photo].nIf you aren't achieving proper results, it could be the water, or the bean you're using. I've had instances where some beans wouldn't generate a great crema, as compared to other varieties. Factors could be the age, the containers their kept in, and all basically relating to the oils and the CO2 trapped in the bean shortly after roasting.nnnnnThe last photo shows a comparison between pours. The first pour (left) often providing the most crema from a brew, while the subsequent pours (right) may not have as much. It helps to spread the first pour over each shot if you have more than one shot to serve, and then pour the rest of the coffee along the side of the cup as not to disturb the cream on top. Sometimes, a brand new Brikka needs 3-4 brews before it begins creating its magic. But even so, if you aren't achieving your preferred result, try these tips: nnTry to lessen the water below the water linennnstart with a shot's worth of water then see what you get, then just increase to get a proportion you're happy with).nnTry filtered waternnnyou'd be surprised how big a difference water quality can make.nnChange the bean you're using, until you get your desired results. nnnSome beans offer varying levels of crema, whether it's because of the CO2 content from the roast or just the overall nature of the bean.nnnGood luck! And don't worry, at the end of the day it boils (or brews) down to personal preference.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I remember discussing the merits of different espresso machines a while back at my local coffee shop with a seasoned barista. His advice was that anything priced below $1000 would produce sub-par espresso.nIs this a good rule of thumb? In other words...nWhat is the minimum amount of money one should spend when investing in a at-home espresso machine?nFor the purposes of this question, I'm interested in semi-automatic espresso machines. It would be used to make straight espresso and espresso beverages.nnnIt's important to note that you should be thinking of your entire espresso budget (i.e. Machine, Grinder, and Accessories) when trying to find the 'right' price. If you were to buy a $1000 machine, you'd want to spend minimally $300 on an espresso grinder. If you're looking at spending a $1000 total and go with something that requires a little more technique, maybe the popular Rancilio Silvia / Rocky combination is right for you. Also, some say that the grinder is actually the most important component to consider when trying to make amazing coffee on a budget. It might be worth shorting yourself a bit on the machine to afford yourself a better grinder in the long run. I'd recommend the Baratza Vario as a starting point. It's pricier, but it does a fantastic job for both drip and espresso. Also, Baratza has amazing support/service and a history of quality. That can be worth quite a bit in the long run.nnnAfter years of experience, the answer is simply depends on your budget and how much you want to invest in coffee.nThis is coffee; if you are experienced, you can brew magic out of one dollar cezve or a two dollar moka. If you use low quality beans you may spoil ten grand espresso machines.nFirst, believe in your technique and invest in your experience, then invest in the gadgets.nRegarding the actual amount you have mentioned in your question, my humble advice is, one grand is quite a lot of money for a home style espresso machine. There are lots of choices that can produce acceptable quality espresso for even a few hundred dollars. I am sure you can find a very suitable semi-automatic desktop espresso machine for one grand. Even if you cannot, there are many other alternatives you can brew tasteful coffee such as aeropress, V60, French press, etc. those are way cheaper than one thousand dollars. There are always alternative ways to explore a new cup of coffee. After all these years, I am still exploring.nnnMy first espresso machine was a Nuova Simonelli Oscar which I bought for $400 on Craigslist. I have switched to a fully manual Olympia Cremina since then, which costs three times more, and is in a sense, a far more difficult machine to use. nThe Oscar was exceptionally temp stable, had massive steaming power, made repeatable shots, and was a whole lot of machine for the money. While mine was an exceptional deal, used Oscars usually go for about $800 on the secondary market. They are built like tanks, easy to use and maintain, and are very repairable with a lot of parts available in case something fails. nHowever, if you don't mind monitoring a whole lot more variables, a La Pavoni Europiccola runs well below $1k and can make as amazing of espresso shots as your technique allows. Far more fun. nnnBreville has some pretty affordable equipment that can make good espresso. The Breville Dual-Boiler, in particular, has received positive feedback from David Schomer himself. nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I have been trouble shooting some of my own espresso and realised that my lower-end machine might just be unable to make a better shot due to having a pressurised portafilter. So with that I wanted to find out what real differences having an unpressurised portafilter there are compared with a pressurised one.nFor those interested, my current espresso problems are as follows:nI manage to get the grind to a size where I'm noticing good thin mouse tail pours but the lack of thick, golden brown crema makes me think I can get a better shot.nI've read that light coloured crema or thin crema is a symptom of underextraction, depending on the length of the shot (where mine was in and around 20 seconds for a double shot, so relatively fast). I then ground finer and the extraction immediately changed. The mouse tails disappeared and the extraction was fast, almost instantly blonding within a second of the extraction. Liquid was not pouring out extremely fast but in comparison with the slower previous extraction it was relatively fast. I tried to continue to lower the grind size to attempt to slow the extraction but to no avail.nCould this be a problem with the pressurised portafilter?nnnPressurized portafilters either restrict water flow or require a certain buildup of pressure before the espresso spills out the bottom of the portafilter. nSo there are several problems with that taste-wise in espresso. The resistance is now not in the ground coffee itself, but below it. Additionally, if your coffee is ground finely and uniformly in a good espresso grinder (as one would for a non-pressurized portafilter), this sort of portafilter will result in too much resistance and thus a slow, over-extracted shot. It can also make your crema look a bit odd because it can emulsify some of the oils in your extracted shot (depending on the design of the specific portafilter).nEssentially the requisite grind size to produce acceptable espresso using a pressurized portafilter is much larger than that of optimal or delicious espresso.nThis sort of portafilter does have its upsides, though. If you don't have access to a quality espresso grinder, and you are using either store-ground beans or imprecisely/more coarsely ground beans, a pressurized portafilter can make acceptable espresso from them whereas the results in a standard portafilter would be very watery and underextracted.nnnA pressurized portafilter, from what I understand, is a way for an espresso machine that does not provide a high enough amount of pressure (a typical industry grade machine pushes about 9 bars of pressure), and to still be able to emulsify the oils in the coffee - creating crema. First off crema is a terrible interpretation of espresso - use your pallet always! If it's underextracted, you will taste it. Then as you get dialed in, you can use the phases/color of crema to tell you information as it pulls. But with a lower-end machine - a pressurized portafilter is about as good as it gets until you spend more money. Espresso looks beautiful, but looks can often be deceiving. nn",

But I'm not trying to make the best imaginable cup of coffee. I'm trying to make about 200 decent cups of coffee a day, for relatively little investment.nI've cleaned out the machine with Goo Gone coffee maker cleaner, to no significant effect. Past that, everything I can think of involves permanent changes to the process, and I want to have some way to justify that before I push for it. Where would my investments of money and political capital be best directed?nnnThe easiest step would be to swap out the Maxwell House coffee for something of higher quality.  If there are local roasters nearby, check to see if they do wholesale or bulk orders, and then order some 5lb. bags of coffee from them.  Since the idea is to keep costs low, they should be able to grind it for you ahead of time so that you won't have to add the cost of a grinder for the time being.nnnCoffee beans - I mean the type of coffee you actually drip. Exchange the coffee for 100% arabica coffee. it does not have to be even single source coffee. Good start for decent cup of coffee is ... You bet, it is Starbucks.nWhile I personally am in movement away from Starbucks, it should be good choice for decent cup of coffee for reasonable pricennnMy suggestion would be that you stop using the machine and take a pour over cone or french press and your own grinder to work.  The reality that I have found is that most people are willing to drink horrible coffee so long as it is free.  And that given that choice, most people would rather drink free horrible coffee than good coffee they have to pay for.  I tried for a long time to have a 'coffee pool' at my office.  What I found is that a couple of people payed me money every now and again, but mostly, my good coffee just got poached by people that didn't notice the difference between it and Folgers.  I am much happier making my own cup of coffee when I want and not dealing with anything political or financial with my fellow employees. nnnIf you think you can get some money but not a lot, I'd start by switching to whole-bean coffee and purchasing both a grinder and air-tight containers to store the coffee in. Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day. Coffee is best when it's used within about 2 weeks of being roasted and ground, though it'll still be drinkable longer than that, especially if stored properly. nThe other thing you can do that doesn't cost any money is to experiment with how much coffee you use per pot. I've been in a lot of offices where people assume that more grounds automatically means better coffee, but adding too many grounds can lead to a very unpleasant bitter, metallic, or acidic taste. So try adding slightly less coffee when brewing a fresh pot and see if that helps, even if you don't change anything else.nnnIt'll be best to take a multi-faceted approach, there are some things you can do that don't require a significant monetary investment, but it will cost you a bit of time in the name of science. nFirst, try having decent filtered water delivered, and use that to fill the machine. I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how any coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.nSecond, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not always true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.nThird, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. nFinally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can really help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. nI think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:nnHaving the machine professionally cleanednHaving better water delivered, and using that to brewnTossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grindsnnThe machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically.nn",

I think that the blood flow is fundamental to avoid feeling drowsy but whenever I drink coffee after a meal I get really alert and almost feel no post-meal drowsiness.nnnI am by no means a biochemist/physiologist, but I will give this my best scientific go.nThe main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, 'get the 'itis' as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. nnThis stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpufnnDangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).nTryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!nNow, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness.nThis is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.nIt is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapsesnnTL;DR: After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis. When you ingest coffee, which contains caffeine, it counteracts this and keeps you awake and alert.nn",

This is normal occurrence for almost every type of coffee maker.nWhen NOT to clean your Moka potnIn daily use, do not use soap and water to clean the pot. This is because oils from the coffee will build up in the pot and contribute to the flavour of the coffee for each concurrent use.

(Safer and more pleasant)nnNotice: Don't boil these solutions as the fumes can cause damage to your eyes and respiratory tract.nWhen to consider throwing out your Moka potnIf your flavour is still affected after you descale it, you may be dealing with some rust. If you happen to notice any rust inside or your coffee just has a strange taste after some amount of time and many brews, you may need to consider getting a new one.nGood luck. If you have any questions, feel free to post them or comment here.nnnIf it's in the water well then it's most likely mineral deposits from hard water OR oxidation. I think the sentiment against cleaning is in regards to detergents and the pot should be rinsed with water and let dry thoroughly to avoid any oxidation in the future. If the problem is mineral deposits it is just due to the water used in brewing and is not a major problem.nI would try to use something acidic such as vinegar to clean the pot and attempt to get out any minerals out. Cleaning it definitely can't hurt if it's affecting your flavor.nAs for the gasket, if it looks worn out or the metal is damaged I would just replace it when you have a chance.

Then you are basically forced to loosen your grind to a coarser grind size.nThen you could pull your normale at: n20g in | 25s | 30g outnHopefully that answers your question!nn",

When I'm using the Nespresso (pull one u2018latteu2019, pull a second u2018lungou2019 into the latte), I get maybe 9oz of coffee-product; and that's stretching the phrase, as it's basically slightly-coffee-tainted steamed-milk.

If you wanted to do this 'correctly', you would use the steam wand of your espresso machine - which the Nespresso doesn't have, I presume.   nnIf you have an immersion blender, preferably with a disk, heat (not boil!) your milk and whizz it until you get soft foam.   nOther options are a stovetop or electric milk frother - the manual pump-action ones are available for the price of four to five Starbucks coffees, the electric ones cost a bit more. nDo not buy one of these teeny-tiny hand-held flimsy wire-whisk stirrers, they are a funny gadget but not sturdy enough for daily use and large volumes of milk.nnThe milk-to-foam-to-espresso ratio is up to you, find what you like best.

This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.nI am however wondering if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective.nnnYou're actually asking two different questions. nThe minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more fresh coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat off) flavor component to your brew.nNow whether that flavor component contributes to any any perceptible change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between '100% fresh' and 'Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.'nYour analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of soap on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily tasted if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still essentially coffee (somewhat off coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of 'a few drops' of off coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no perceptible effect on taste. nI also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is not evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely stainless, so you are not likely building up any patinau2026 so you are essentially 'washing away' the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee. There should be no substantial, cumulative effect.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "Lately, coffee from my very basic Mr. Coffee 5-cup drip brewer has been watery tasting, and I am hoping for some troubleshooting help.nI recently purchased of a Cuisinart DBM-8 (a basic automatic grinder) to replace an even more basic blade grinder. This grinder has allows for a grind amounts in increments of '2 coffee cups' starting from 4 cups.nMy coffee did not become watery upon first use of the DBM-8. I usually brew using 16 to 20 fluid oz of water, and I have switched between the 4-cup and the 6-cup setting on the grinder. I found that the 6-cup setting tasted pretty good, but seemed to use up a lot of beans.nWith all that said, what has happened for the past week is that coffee made using my brewer has been tasting watery, no matter if I use the 4-cup or the 6-cup grind setting, and whether I try more or less water. I have set the coarseness of the grind to medium, which I believe is appropriate. All I am getting is colored hot water.nWhen I inspect the coffee filter and the grounds after brewing with the 6-cup grind, I observe a portion of the coffee grounds appear dry on top, although beneath that, the coffee grounds appear wet. It's as if the hot water is going directly through the filter without soaking enough in the grounds.nIs my coffee maker broken? I tried cleaning with diluted vinegar, but this did not change things.nIs it the beans? I do switch around, but the beans I buy are in the 10-20$ range per pound. I keep the beans in the closed hopper of the grinder.nnnWell this is a strange problem but it seems to have to do with the new grinder you are using or the way you use it since the grind is the only variable that has changed (according to your story).nWatery coffee most often means that you don't use enough ground coffee. Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer.nIf this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure.nI suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered. In theory the water should then distribute much more evenly through the grounds. I'd suggest you do this only after you have solved the general problem as a means to improve the flavor. It'd definitely be a quite 'hacky' solution and I think first of all your machine should work the way it is supposed to.nn",

            "long_summary__c": "I recently started to brew my own coffee using the pour-over method because buying from the coffee shop was getting too expensive for a daily coffee drinker. I bought a bag of coffee grounds and a coffee dripper online. The dripper is a stainless steel type with a couple fine mesh filters in it, which lets me do pour overs without a paper filter.nHere's my method: I'm putting 3 tablespoons of grounds into my dripper, and then with a kettle of 17oz, just off the boiling water, begin pouring over my grounds with enough water to fill the dripper half full. I wait 10 seconds while the grounds bloom and then I fill the dripper to the top and wait for the coffee to brew. Then, when the dripper gets about half empty, I fill it back up with water. I intend to end with ~16oz of coffee.nMy problem is that the grounds end up plugging up my dripper and the drip process ends up taking forever. By the time all the water has passed through my coffee grounds and dripper the coffee is COLD!nWhat am I doing wrong? Am I trying to get too much coffee out of the pour-over method? Is it really only meant for a single cup serving? Like 6oz and 1 tablespoon of grounds? Are my grounds not fine enough?nEDIT:nDespite what everyone is saying here, I've done a little research and I've read that when doing pour overs, you want your grind to be more fine. They say the consistency of sugar, not sea salt. I find a little truth to this in that when I originally bought the dripper, I used a bag that had grounds that have been much more fine that what I've been using lately. Needless to say, I think I just need to experiment with it.nnnnYou need to use a coarser grind.  You have grounds that are just the right size to block the mesh. Too small and they'll just pass through, making your coffee gritty.  Medium-sized and they'll block the mesh.  Large (coarse) enough, and coffee can flow around them.  Not too large: you won't be able to extract enough from the beans with this brewing method using very coarse grounds.nHow are you grinding now?  If you're using a blade grinder, you'll often get a large variety of grain sizes (from very fine to very coarse), which means those medium and fine grains will start to clog to holes, even if much of the grounds are coarse.  A burr grinder will give you more consistency.nPersonally, I would recommend a plastic or ceramic pour-over brewer, which uses a paper filter.  This method is much more forgiving.  Paper filters won't get clogged with medium grains, and fine grains won't pass through.  I can easily brew 8-16 ounces with my 'single-cup' pour-over brewer.nOne last suggestion: Give your bloom more than 10 seconds!  60 seconds will give your grounds enough time to fully bloom and become ready for further brewing.nGood luck!nnnApart from the fact that the dripper itself may have a design flaw (does it work for small servings?):nSurely enough, the diameter of the dripper's lower throughput sieven a) influences maximum dripping speedn b) determines how much pressure will build up, given mass of coffee grounds and of waternSo while designing a dripper properly, a target serving size has to be assumed and I'm assuming it wouldn't have been your 16oz, rather max. half of it.nYou could probably make the grounds coarser to prevent clogging (e.g., pebbles wouldn't clog your filter's water passage way, sand would), but when you go too coarse, the throughout may become too fast and you'll get thin coffee without proper substance/taste. So you'll have to findu200b d your optimal configuration.nHow you pour water has an effect, as well. Pouring too quickly may lead to pressure that contributes to clogging. Don't pour all the water at once, have a slow steady stream that you distribute over the uoper surface of the grounds. Keep the falling distance for the water/the distance between your hot water output and.the coffee grounds' surface minimal (=less velocity -> less pressure).nAlso, pour hot water into the container your dripper is supposed to drip into prior to brewing, let it warm up (it doesn't have to be all filled up, you can sway it/close and rotate it to distribute the heat - don't waste too much energy), then empty just prior to dripping. How long you should optimally warm up depends on your container material, of course - a thick mug warmed up long enough will retain heat for a long, good time :) Thin porcelain doesn't need long warming, obviously.nYou can also warm up the cup by microwaving it with a little water inside (be careful not to have the water evaporate/ overheat the cup), but I've found microwaves often don't heat up uniformly...  nP.s.: When getting rid of the warm water, you can first pour it through your empty coffee dripper, so that is also warmed up (no need for extra water on that, it's thin metal with little heat resistance, anyways, so pouring through warm water will most likely do the trick)nnnI think the best way to try and sort this out is experimenting with the grind. If your coffee granules are a similar size to the mesh, they'll just lodge in and very little liquid will be able to get through. Obviously a finer grind will fall through, so try a coarser grind for better water flow.nIf you do like your brew with a finer grind though, you might be better off with a paper filter in a V60 instead.nnnTo accurately judge whether your grind is too fine or too coarse you'll want to time the brew from when you begin pouring until the last water passes through the grounds. Too fine of a grind produces excessively long brew times and too coarse of a grind produces too short brew times.nIf your brew time is too short, the coffee will taste sour. If it is too long, the coffee will be bitter.nOther factors that influence the appearance of these undesirable flavors are the consistency of the grind and the temperature of the water. If your grind is not consistent it will have particles of varying size. The finer particles will extract quickly and then impart bitter flavors to the coffee. And the coarsest particles will be under-extracted and will impart sour flavors. Both will be present in coffee that is incorrectly ground.nWater temperature also affects the appearance of these flavors. Under-heated water will under-extract the coffee and overheated water will over-extract it.nTo maintain your sanity while adjusting these variables it is best to use the same amount of coffee and water each time you brew and to follow the same technique when pouring. Don't measure the coffee by volume but rather by weight. The same volume of coffee ground to different particle sizes can vary greatly in weight. And don't mix units of measure. Grams are far more of an accurate unit of measure than ounces. To keep your coffee to water ratio constant you'll also want to weigh the water as you pour it.nA common kitchen scale and timer are all you need for this. Your water should be between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. And for a starting guideline for total brewing time try aiming for a three to four minute brew time window. Begin with a coffee to water ratio of 1:16. After you get the other factors figured out you can adjust the ratio to get the strength of brew you prefer. While experimenting vary only one thing per brew until you can dial in the perfect settings for your taste. The final judge of your results is whether you like it.nn",

Since this is outside the realm of what I normally do at home with a french press so I thought I better check that I'm not making any horrible mistakes.nOne of our big concerns is that this event will likely have quite a few somewhat-discerning coffee drinkers. We also need to be able to brew coffee in the middle of the night when any local coffee shop has closed.nYears ago, I remember helping out with a percolator at a big event and that seems like the best approach this time. I've seen it done more recently and after some research it seems like the common approach. I also found a local rental location that will rent us a few for our event that each have a capacity of 100 cups.nIs there a better approach? If a percolator is the right approach, what beans/grounds will produce the best flavor? How many lbs/kgs of coffee will likely be needed?nnnYour problem depends more on the shape of the data than the raw quantities. 900 cups in 24 hours is one cup every 40 seconds or so, which isn't so bad, however I doubt that's the distribution of actual orders!nI'm going to assume all of your 300 guests want to have a cup of coffee during a one-hour period. This works out as 5 coffees a minute, or one every 12 seconds.nI'm ignoring factors of manpower, cost etc., and focussing on coffee preparation only :-)nYou can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones. Assuming each one takes ~6 minutes to cycle (prepare, brew for 4 mins, serve, rinse), meaning you can serve 2 people a minute with one pot. 3 pots would allow you to serve 6 people a minute (amortised) and serve 300 people in an hour. A few more pots would make it very comfortable. Assuming you're grinding the coffee fresh, you'll get a far superior brew from this than perk coffee that's been sitting there for 20 minutes.nSo serving people fast enough shouldn't be too hard, but boiling water fast enough might be, and for that you just need an urn, with which you can keep a large enough supply of boiling water to just fill up and go.nn",
